the "center-of-the-aisle" packaged foods business. Ever since its founding and membership in the industry, the company has focused on gaining market share. In 2017, it had, by far, the largest market share in the industry and used this advantage to create order and discipline in the industry, particularly in terms of prices. Starting in late 2016, Gamma Food Products\' VP of Marketing, Polly Kundig noticed the heads of Gamma\'s four largest competitors were meeting often surreptitiously, particularly at trade shows. Parallelly, Kundig also noticed that the four firms were pricing their products at around the same level and distinct from the prices of others, including Gamma.

In such approaches, the source of profits is the differential strategic efficiency and effectiveness of a firm. Collusion exists when firms in an industry or market cooperate to reduce competition. Thus, firms engaged in collusion are attempting to profit, not via efficiency or effectiveness, but by reducing competition. \nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 179\nLearning Obj.:  7.1: Define Explicit and Tacit Collusion and Explain Why Collusion is Typically Inconsistent with Social Welfare in an Economy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n24) What are the two types of collusion and how are they different?\nAnswer:  Collusion can take one of two forms, explicit collusion or tacit collusion. Explicit collusion exists when firms in an industry directly negotiate agreements about how to reduce competition. When members of OPEC met and agreed to reduce oil shipments in 1973, they were engaged in explicit collusion. Explicit collusion is illegal in most developed countries. Tacit collusion exists when firms cooperate in reducing competition, but engage in no face to face negotiations to do so. Tacit collusion can be legal. However, firms that engage in any kind of collusion face fundamental ethical challenges.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 180\nLearning Obj.:  7.1: Define Explicit and Tacit Collusion and Explain Why Collusion

reduce competition but do so without face to face negotiations. Tacit collusion, in short, is implemented via signals and signaling. Signaling both promotes tacit collusion as well as work to reduce the impact of such collusion. Signals can be tough or soft. In a tough signal, if parties cheat on collusive agreements, the firm sending the signal will decrease prices more or increase output more than would have otherwise been the case. Tough signals keep tacit collusion in check. In contrast, in a soft signal, if parties cheat on collusive agreements, the firm sending the signal will decrease its prices less or increase its output less than would have otherwise been the case. Essentially, the firm sending a soft signal is indicating that it is avoiding competition. \nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 189\nLearning Obj.:  7.3: Describe Different Ways That Collusive Agreements can Fall Apart, and How it is Possible to Use the Attributes of an Industry to Anticipate How Sustainable These Agreements are Likely to Be.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n92) How does product homogeneity facilitate tacit collusion?\nAnswer:  One of the industry attributes that facilitates tacit collusion is product homogeneity. Tacit collusion is more likely when firms produce and sell similar products or services. In general, changes in prices are easier to monitor than are changes in product characteristics or features. A firm may cheat on a tacit collusion strategy by charging the agreed upon price but providing more features, higher quality, or better service (thereby creating heterogeneity in its offerings). These efforts at product differentiation are somewhat more difficult to monitor and thus create strong incentives for cheating. When product homogeneity is high, cheating is easier to monitor. \nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 194\nLearning Obj.:  7.3: Describe Different Ways That Collusive Agreements can Fall Apart, and How it is Possible to Use the Attributes of an Industry to Anticipate How Sustainable These Agreements are Likely to Be.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n93) Who are price leaders and what effect does their presence have on tacit collusion?\nAnswer:  A price leader is a firm that sets "acceptable" industry prices or "acceptable" profit margins in an industry. Typically, the price leader is the one with the largest market share. This helps create the order and discipline needed to make tacit collusion last over time. Also, a price leader can assist an industry adjusting to higher or lower prices, without jeopardizing an overall cooperative agreement, by defining industry standards for price or margin changes. Thus, the existence of a price leader creates opportunities for tacit collusion in an industry.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 194\nLearning Obj.:  7.3: Describe Different Ways That Collusive Agreements can Fall Apart, and How it is Possible to Use the Attributes of an Industry to Anticipate How Sustainable These Agreements are Likely to Be.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n94) While there are several industry attributes that facilitate tacit collusion, entry barriers are considered the most important. Why?\nAnswer:  Without barriers to entry, the economic profits associated with tacit collusion create incentives for firms to enter into an industry. New entry into an industry reduces the collusion-enhancing attributes of the other industry characteristics. For example, new entry is likely to create both product heterogeneity (as new firms introduce new products) and cost heterogeneity (new firms often have costs different from colluding incumbents). In general, new entrants can be thought of as loose cannons in otherwise placid and calm industries. To reduce the threat of new entrants, tacitly colluding firms must be protected by barriers to entry.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 196\nLearning Obj.:  7.3: Describe Different Ways That Collusive Agreements can Fall Apart, and How it is Possible to Use the Attributes of an Industry to Anticipate How Sustainable These Agreements are Likely to Be.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n95) How does industry social structure explain collusion among Major League Baseball franchises in the 1980s?\nAnswer:  Industry social structure refers to accepted norms of behavior and competition that often evolve in industries. These norms are usually implicit and constitute what might be called an industry culture. While each Major League Baseball franchise is independently owned, franchise owners must cooperate in leagues to establish playing schedules, a common set of rules, and other operating standards. While engaging in this legal cooperation, informal agreements not to bid aggressively on free agents were apparently struck. An arbitrator ruled that the owners had colluded.\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 195\nLearning Obj.:  7.3: Describe Different Ways That Collusive Agreements can Fall Apart, and How it is Possible to Use the Attributes of an Industry to Anticipate How Sustainable These Agreements are Likely to Be.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n96) One of the most significant organizational issues facing tacitly colluding firms concerns the ________.\nA) reputation of the firm\nB) efficiency of their operations\nC) financial viability of their products\nD) effect on their employees\nAnswer:  B\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 197\nLearning Obj.:  7.4: Describe Two Unique Challenges Associated With Organizing to Implement a Collusion Strategy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n97) One of the most significant organizational issues facing tacitly colluding firms concerns the efficiency of their operations.\nAnswer:  TRUE\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 197\nLearning Obj.:  7.4: Describe Two Unique Challenges Associated With Organizing to Implement a Collusion Strategy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n',8:"Strategic Management and Competitive Advantage, 6e (Barney)\nChapter 8   Vertical Integration\n\n1) Vertical integration is a type of\nA) business strategy.\nB) generic strategy.\nC) differentiation strategy.\nD) corporate strategy.\nAnswer:  D\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.1: Define Corporate Strategy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n2) Business strategy is a firm's theory of how to gain competitive advantage by operating in several businesses simultaneously.\nAnswer:  FALSE\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.1: Define Corporate Strategy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n3) Decisions about whether or not to vertically integrate often determine whether or not a firm is operating in a single business or industry or multiple businesses or industries.\nAnswer:  TRUE\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.1: Define Corporate Strategy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n4) The number of steps in a firm's value chain that it accomplishes within its boundaries describes the firm's level of\nA) product differentiation.\nB) diversification.\nC) vertical integration.\nD) competitive dynamics.\nAnswer:  C\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n5) When Apple, Inc. opened retail stores to sell its computers and iPods, this was an example of\nA) forward vertical integration.\nB) backward vertical integration.\nC) forward horizontal integration.\nD) backward horizontal integration.\nAnswer:  A\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Application of Knowledge\n6) If Dell computers were to open its own factory to manufacture the LCD televisions it sells at its online store, this would be an example of\nA) forward vertical integration.\nB) product differentiation.\nC) forward horizontal integration.\nD) backward vertical integration.\nAnswer:  D\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Application of Knowledge\n\n7) A firm's ________ measures the percentage of a firm's sales that is generated by activities done within the boundaries of a firm.\nA) value added as a percentage of sales\nB) simple product diversification\nC) competitive advantage\nD) competitive dynamic\nAnswer:  A\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 6\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n8) Which of the following is not used to determine a firm's level of vertical integration using the value added as a percentage of sales approach?\nA) value added\nB) net income\nC) sales\nD) gross margin\nAnswer:  D\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 6\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n9) A firm with a ________ ratio between value added and sales has brought ________ of the value-creating activities associated with its business inside its boundaries, consistent with a high level of vertical integration.\nA) low;

More vertically integrated firms accomplish more stages of the value chain within their boundaries than less vertically integrated firms. Less vertically integrated firms accomplish fewer stages of the value chain within their boundaries than more vertically integrated firms. A firm engages in backward vertical integration when it incorporates more stages of the value chain within its boundaries and those stages bring a firm closer to the beginning of the value chain, i.e., closer to gaining access to raw materials.

The company manufactures its own GPS units, which are smaller than those of any other competitor and include a proprietary battery that lasts 200% longer than any other competitor's battery and that TerraLoc manufacturers on-site. TerraLoc also has developed proprietary software that is much faster and more precise than that of any competitor. When developing the proprietary battery, TerraLoc decided to manufacturer the battery in-house to reduce the possibility that the company it outsourced the battery manufacturing to might reverse engineer the battery and sell a similar product to competitors. This possibility was especially troubling given that the company expected a significant increase in demand due to the improved battery life. Additionally, TerraLoc sells its products and services through its own direct sales force to ensure that its representatives highlight the longer battery life of TerraLoc's units.\n\n37) TerraLoc's

discuss how value is created under each.\nAnswer:  There are three explanations of how firms can create value through vertical integration:\na. Opportunism-Based Explanation: Reducing opportunistic threats from a firm's buyers and suppliers due to any transaction specific investments it may have made.\nb. Capabilities-Based Explanation: By enabling a firm to exploit its valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources and capabilities.\nc. Flexibility-Based Explanation: When the decision-making environment is uncertain, firms create value by engaging in vertical integration. Under high uncertainty vertical integration can commit a firm to a costly-to-reverse course of action and the flexibility of a non-vertically integrated may be preferred.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n59) Discuss the opportunism-based explanation of vertical integration value creation and identify when, under this explanation, firms should vertically integrate. In your answer be sure to clearly define opportunism and the role that transaction-specific investments play in the opportunism-based explanation.\nAnswer:  One of the best known explanations of when vertical integration can be valuable focuses on using vertical integration to reduce the threat of opportunism. Opportunism exists when a firm is unfairly exploited in an exchange. Obviously, when one of its exchange partners behaves opportunistically, this reduces the economic value of a firm. The threat of opportunism is greatest when a party to an exchange has made what are called transaction-specific investments. A transaction-specific investment is any investment in an exchange that has significantly more value in the current exchange than it does in alternative exchanges.\nOne way to reduce the threat of opportunism is to bring an exchange within the boundary of a firm. That is, one way to reduce the threat of opportunism is to vertically integrate into this exchange. This way, managers in a firm can directly monitor and control this exchange instead of relying on the market to manage this exchange. If the exchange that is brought within the boundary of a firm brings a firm closer to its ultimate suppliers, it is an example of backward vertical integration. If the exchange that is brought within the boundary of a firm brings a firm closer to its ultimate customer, it is an example of forward vertical integration.\nOf course, firms should only bring market exchanges within their boundaries when the cost of vertical integration is less than the cost of opportunism. If the cost of vertical integration is greater than the cost of opportunism, then firms should not vertically integrate into an exchange. This is the case for both backward and forward vertical integration decisions.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n60) Discuss the firm capabilities-based explanation of how vertical integration can create value. In your discussion identify the two broad implications of this approach and when, under this approach, firms should engage in vertical integration.\nAnswer:  The capabilities-based explanation of how vertical integration can create value focuses on firm capabilities and their ability to generate sustained competitive advantages. This approach has two broad implications. First, it suggests that firms should vertically integrate into those business activities where they possess valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources and capabilities. This way, firms can appropriate at least some of the profits that using these capabilities to exploit environmental opportunities will create. Second, this approach also suggests that firms should not vertically integrate into business activities where they do not possess the resources necessary to gain competitive advantages. Such vertical integration decisions would not be a source of profits to a firm since they do not possess any of the valuable, rare, or costly-to-imitate resources needed to gain competitive advantages in these business activities. Indeed, to the extent that some other firms have competitive advantages in these business activities, vertically integrating into them could put a firm at a competitive disadvantage. Under this approach, a firm should pursue vertical integration into an activity when it has valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources in a business activity, vertically integrate into that activity. If a firm does not have valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources in a business activity and other firms already engaging in this activity do, the firm will find itself at a competitive disadvantage.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 9\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n61) Discuss the flexibility-based explanation of vertical integration. In discussing this explanation be sure to define flexibility, the role of uncertainty in this explanation, and identify when, under this explanation, firms should engage in vertical integration.\nAnswer:  The flexibility-based explanation of vertical integration focuses on the impact of vertical integration on a firm's flexibility. Flexibility refers to how costly it is for a firm to alter its strategic and organizational decisions. Flexibility is high when the cost of changing strategic choices is low; flexibility is low when the cost of changing strategic choices is high. In general, vertical integration reduces flexibility since it has committed its organizational structure, its management controls, and its compensation policies to a particular vertically integrated way of doing business. When a decision-making environment is uncertain, that is when the future value of an exchange cannot be known; when investments in that exchange are being made, the value of vertical integration is decreased and should be avoided.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 10\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n62) Within the flexibility-based approach to vertical integration when should firms engage in strategic alliances instead of vertical integration, and what are the advantages of alliances under these conditions?\nAnswer:  A flexibility-based approach to vertical integration suggests that rather than vertically integrating into a business activity whose value is highly uncertain, firms should not vertically integrate and, instead, should form a strategic alliance to manage this exchange. A strategic alliance is more flexible than vertical integration but still gives a firm enough information about an exchange to estimate its value over time. \nAn alliance has a second advantage in this setting. The downside risks associated with investing in a strategic alliance are known and fixed. They equal the cost of creating and maintaining the alliance. If an uncertain investment turns out to not be valuable, parties to this alliance know the maximum amount they can lose, an amount equal to the cost of creating and maintaining the alliance. On the other hand, if this exchange turns out to be very valuable, then maintaining an alliance can give a firm access to this huge upside potential.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 11\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n63) A firm is likely to be among the first in its industry to vertically disintegrate an exchange when\nA) the firm concludes that the level of specific investment required to manage an economic exchange is high.\nB) the firm believes that the exchange is costly to imitate.\nC) the level of uncertainty about the value of an exchange has increased.\nD) the firm believes that the exchange is rare.\nAnswer:  C\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 16\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n64) Which of the following statements regarding direct duplication and substitutes for vertical integration is accurate?\nA) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices may be subject to direct duplication and substitutes.\nB) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices are subject to neither direct duplication nor substitutes.\nC) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices may be subject to direct duplication but not to substitutes.\nD) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices may be subject to substitutes but not to direct duplication.\nAnswer:  A\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 17\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n65) The major substitute for vertical integration is\nA) vertical disintegration.\nB) strategic alliances.\nC) a product-differentiation strategy.\nD) a low-cost strategy.\nAnswer:  B\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\nTerraLoc competes in the market for global positioning devices and services.

First, a firm may have developed a new technology or a new approach to doing business that requires its business partners to make substantial transaction-specific investments. Firms that engage in these activities will find it in their self-interest to vertically integrate, while firms that have not engaged in these activities will not find it in their self-interest to vertically integrate. If these activities are rare and costly to imitate, they can be a source of competitive advantage for a vertically integrating firm. Second, a firm may have unusual skills or capabilities. If these skills or capabilities are valuable and rare, then vertically integrating into businesses that exploit these capabilities can enable a firm to gain at least a temporary competitive advantage. Finally, a firm may be able to gain an advantage from vertically integrating when it resolves some uncertainty it faces sooner than its competition. In this situation, the firm no longer needs to retain the flexibility and can gain some of the advantages of vertical integration sooner than its competitors and can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 15\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical

competes in the market for global positioning devices and services. The company manufactures its own GPS units, which are smaller than those of any other competitor and include a proprietary battery that lasts 200% longer than any other competitor's battery and that TerraLoc manufacturers on-site. TerraLoc also has developed proprietary software that is much faster and more precise than that of any competitor. When developing the proprietary battery, TerraLoc decided to manufacturer the battery in-house to reduce the possibility that the company it outsourced the battery manufacturing to might reverse engineer the battery and sell a similar product to competitors. This possibility was especially troubling given that the company expected a significant increase in demand due to the improved battery life. Additionally, TerraLoc sells its products and services through its own direct sales force to ensure that its representatives highlight the longer battery life of TerraLoc's units.\n\n91) TerraLoc is most likely to use the ________ organizational structure.\nA) matrix\nB) product-based multidivisional\nC) functional\nD) geography-based multidivisional\nAnswer:  C\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Application of Knowledge\n\n92) If TerraLoc were to use a U-form organizational structure and the CEO decided to use budgets as a management control but wanted to make sure that the managers did not become too focused on the short term, the CEO should do all of the following except\nA) use an open process in developing budgets.\nB) determine budgets for her managers and allow them to focus only on meeting the budgets.\nC) use both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of managers' performance.\nD) make sure that the process used in developing budgets reflects the economic reality facing the firm's managers.\nAnswer:  B\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 19\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Application of Knowledge\n93) The use of budgets in a vertically integrated U-form organization can lead functional managers to overemphasize short-term behavior that is easy to measure and underemphasize longer-term behavior that is more difficult to measure.\nAnswer:  TRUE\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n94) Budgets are an important control tool and they contribute to only positive outcomes.\nAnswer:  FALSE\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 19\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n95) From a CEO's perspective, coordinating functional specialists to implement a vertical integration strategy rarely involves conflict resolution.\nAnswer:  FALSE\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 19\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n96) Numerous conflicts can arise among functional managers in a vertically integrated U-form organization.\nAnswer:  TRUE\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 21\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n97) Capability explanations of vertical integration acknowledge the importance of firm-specific investments in creating value for a firm.\nAnswer:  TRUE\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 22\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n98) Identify the organizational structure that is used to implement a vertical integration strategy and why from a CEO's perspective coordinating functional specialists to implement a vertical integration strategy almost always involves conflict resolution and how this conflict can be resolved.\nAnswer:  The organizational structure that is used to implement a cost-leadership and product-differentiation strategy, the functional or U-form structure, is also used to implement a vertical integration strategy. Indeed, each of the exchanges included within the boundaries of a firm as a result of vertical integration decisions are incorporated into one of the functions in a functional organizational structure. From a CEO's perspective, coordinating functional specialists to implement a vertical integration strategy almost always involves conflict resolution. Conflicts among functional managers in a U-form organization are both expected and normal. Indeed, if there is no conflict among certain functional managers in a U-form organization, then some of these managers probably are not doing their jobs.\nThe task facing the CEO is not to pretend this conflict does not exist, or to ignore it, but to manage it in a way that facilitates strategy implementation. The CEO's job is to help resolve conflicts in ways that facilitate the implementation of the firm's strategy. Functional managers do not have to \"like\" each other. However, if a firm's vertical integration strategy is correct, the reason that a function has been included within the boundaries of a firm is that this decision creates value for the firm. Allowing functional conflicts to get in the way of taking advantage of each of the functions within a firm's boundaries can destroy this potential value.\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n99) Discuss the role of the budgeting process as a control mechanism in vertically integrated U-form organizations, the potential unintended negative consequence budgets can have, and three things CEOs can do to counter this potential consequence.\nAnswer:  Budgeting is one of the most important control mechanisms available to CEOs in vertically integrated U-form organizations. Indeed, in most U-form companies, enormous management effort goes into the creation of budgets and the evaluation of performance relative to budgets. Budgets are developed for costs, revenues, and a variety of other activities performed by a firm's functional managers. Often, managerial compensation and promotion opportunities depend on the ability of a manager to meet budget expectations.\nAlthough budgets are an important control tool, they can also have unintended negative consequences. For example, the use of budgets can lead functional managers to overemphasize short-term behavior that is easy to measure and underemphasize longer-term behavior that is more difficult to measure. CEOs can do a variety of things to counter the \"short-termism\" effects of the budgeting process. Three things a CEO can do to counter \"short-termism\" are to\n1. Ensure that the process used in developing budgets is open and participative\n2. Make sure the budgeting process reflects the economic reality facing functional managers and the firm, and\n3. Augment quantitative evaluations of a functional manager's performance with qualitative evaluations of that performance.\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 19\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n100) What type of compensation approach goes best with the flexibility explanation of vertical integration?\nAnswer:  The creation of flexibility in a firm depends on employees being willing to engage in activities that have fixed and known downside risks and significant upside potential.

or more businesses, one of which accounts for between 70% and 95% of firm revenues.\nRelated-constrained diversification?A firm using this type of related diversification operates in multiple businesses, none of which accounts for more than 70% of firm revenues that share a significant number of dimensions including inputs, production technologies, distribution channels, similar customers,

capability requirements with the businesses the firm is currently pursuing.\nRelated-linked diversification?Firms using this type of related diversification operate in multiple businesses, none of which accounts for more than 70% of a firm's revenues, and these businesses share only a couple of dimensions or have businesses that are linked along very different dimensions.\nUnrelated corporate diversification?When less than 70 percent of a firm's revenues is generated in a single product market and when a firm's businesses share few, if any, common attributes, then that firm is pursuing a

computers and computer-related software and approximately 4% of its revenues were generated from sales of other peripherals. Further, of these revenues, 60% was from sales in the U.S., 30% was from sales in Europe, 7% was from sales in Asia and 3% was from other areas. In October 2001, Peach entered the personal electronics industry by introducing a new MP3 player known as the PeachPit. In developing and selling the PeachPit, Peach Computers was able to use many of the same R&D facilities, suppliers, production facilities, and distribution and sales outlets as the computers and software Peach Computers traditionally sold. By 2003, the PeachPit MP3 Player, accessories for the unit, and sales of songs on Peach Computers' NectarTunes website accounted for 35% of Peach Computers' revenues.\n\n47) Which type of economies of

Second, it must be less costly for managers in a firm to realize these economies of scope than for outside equity holders on their own. If outside investors could realize the value of a particular economy of scope on their own, and at low cost, then they would have few incentives to \"hire\" managers to realize this economy of scope for them.\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  9.2: Specify the Two Conditions that a Corporate Diversification Strategy Must Meet to Create Economic Value (a) Define the Concept of \"Economies of Scope\" and Identify Nine Potential Economies of Scope a Diversified Firm Might Try to Exploit (b) Identify Which of These Economies of Scope a Firm's Outside Equity Investors can Realize on Their Own at Low Cost.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n73) Define the concept of economies of scope, discuss when they are valuable and identify and differentiate between four of the eight potential economies of scope a diversified firm might try to exploit.\nAnswer:  Economies of scope exist in a firm when the value of the products or services it sells increases as a function of the number of businesses that firm operates in. The term \"scope\" in this definition refers to the range of businesses in which a diversified firm operates. For this reason, only diversified firms can, by definition, exploit economies of scope. Economies of scope are valuable to the extent that they increase a firm's revenues or decrease its costs, compared to what would be the case if these economies of scope were not exploited.\nThere are eight different types of economies of scope:\n? Shared activities in which a firm's businesses share a variety of activities throughout their value chains can serve as the basis for operational economies of scope.\n? Core competencies are complex sets of resources and capabilities that link different businesses in a diversified firm through managerial and technical know-how, experience, and wisdom.\n? Internal capital allocation. In a sense, diversification creates an internal capital market in which businesses in a diversified firm compete for corporate capital. An internal capital market creates value for a diversified firm when it offers some efficiency advantages over an external capital market.\n? Risk reduction. Diversified firms can achieve a lower level of risk if they build a business portfolio that has a low correlation between the cash flows of the businesses in the portfolio.\n? Tax advantages. A diversified firm can use losses in some of its businesses to offset profits in others, thereby reducing its overall tax liability. Second, because diversification can reduce the riskiness of a firm's cash flows, it can also reduce the probability that a firm will declare bankruptcy. This can increase a firm's debt capacity, which is particularly important in tax environments where interest payments on debt are tax deductible.\n? Multipoint competition is an anticompetitive economy of scope that exists when two or more diversified firms simultaneously compete in multiple markets. Multipoint competition can serve to facilitate a particular type of tacit collusion called mutual forbearance in which firms forgo acts of competitive strategies in one business because of the possibility of retaliation by a competitor in another business.\n? Exploiting market power. Internal allocations of capital among a diversified firm's businesses may enable it to exploit in some of its businesses the market power advantages it enjoys in other of its businesses through actions such as subsidizing the operations of another of its businesses.\n? Maximizing management compensation. Managers seeking to maximize their income should attempt to grow their firm. One of the easiest ways to grow a firm is through diversification, especially unrelated diversification through mergers and acquisitions that can allow a diversified firm to grow substantially in a short period of time, leading senior managers to earn higher incomes.\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  9.2: Specify the Two Conditions that a Corporate Diversification Strategy Must Meet to Create Economic Value (a) Define the Concept of \"Economies of Scope\" and Identify Nine Potential Economies of Scope a Diversified Firm Might Try to Exploit (b) Identify Which of These Economies of Scope a Firm's Outside Equity Investors can Realize on Their Own at Low Cost.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n74) Discuss shared activities as a potential source of economies of scope for diversified firms and identify the potential benefits and limits of activity sharing.\nAnswer:  When the companies in a diversified firm share a variety of activities throughout their value chains, these activities can serve as the basis for operational economies of scope. Potential shared activities can be found throughout a firm's value chain from input activities through dealer support and service. Activity sharing can have the effect of reducing a diversified firm's costs, and failure to exploit share activities across business can lead to out-of-control costs. Shared activities can also increase the revenues in a diversified firm's businesses through shared product development and sales activities as well as by enhancing business revenues by exploiting strong, positive reputations of some of a firm's businesses in other of its businesses. There are three important limits to activity sharing. First, substantial organizational issues can be associated with a diversified firm's learning how to manage cross-business relationships. Second, sharing activities may limit the ability of a particular business to meet its specific customer's needs. Finally, if one business in a diversified firm has a poor reputation, sharing activities with that business can reduce the quality of the reputation of other businesses in the firm.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 8\nLearning Obj.:  9.2: Specify the Two Conditions that a Corporate Diversification Strategy Must Meet to Create Economic Value (a) Define the Concept of \"Economies of Scope\" and Identify Nine Potential Economies of Scope a Diversified Firm Might Try to Exploit (b) Identify Which of These Economies of Scope a Firm's Outside Equity Investors can Realize on Their Own at Low Cost.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n75) Identify and discuss the two economies of scope that do not have the potential for generating positive returns for a firm's outside equity investors.\nAnswer:  The only two economies of scope that do not have the potential for generating positive returns for a firm's equity holders are diversification in order to maximize the size of a firm and diversification to reduce risk. Diversification in order to maximize the size of a firm does not generate positive returns because firm size, per se, is not valuable. Diversification in order to reduce risk does not generate positive returns because equity holders can do this on their own at a very low cost by simply investing in a diversified portfolio of

Analytical Thinking\n\nAt the beginning of 2001, Peach Computers competed exclusively in the computer industry and generated approximately 96% of its revenue from the sales of computers and computer-related software and approximately 4% of its revenues were generated from sales of other peripherals. Further, of these revenues, 60% was from sales in the U.S., 30% was from sales in Europe, 7% was from sales in Asia and 3% was from other areas. In October 2001, Peach entered the personal electronics industry by introducing a new MP3 player known as the PeachPit. In developing and selling the PeachPit, Peach Computers was able to use many of the same R&D facilities, suppliers, production facilities, and distribution and sales outlets as the computers and software Peach Computers traditionally sold. By 2003, the PeachPit MP3 Player, accessories for the unit, and sales of songs on Peach Computers' NectarTunes website accounted for 35% of Peach Computers' revenues.\n\n83) If no other firm in the

particular economies of scope associated with that diversification are. If only a few competing firms have exploited a particular economy of scope, that economy of scope can be rare. If numerous firms have done so, it will be common and not a source of competitive advantage.\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 23\nLearning Obj.:  9.3: Specify the Circumstances Under Which a Firm's Diversification Strategy Will be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage (a) Explain Which of the Economies of Scope Identified in this Chapter are More Likely to be Subject to Low-Cost Imitation and Which are Less Likely to be Subject to Low-Cost Imitation (b) Identify Two Potential Substitutes for Corporate Diversification.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n96) Identify which economies of scope are more likely to be subject to low-cost imitation and which are less likely to be subject to low-cost imitation and discuss why each is either costly or less costly to duplicate.\nAnswer:  The extent to which a valuable and rare corporate diversification strategy is immune from direct duplication depends on how costly it is for competing firms to realize this same economy of scope. Some economies of scope are, in general, more costly to duplicate than others. Shared activities, risk reduction, tax advantages, and employee compensation as bases for corporate diversification are usually relatively easy to duplicate. Because shared activities are based on tangible assets that a firm exploits across multiple businesses, such as common R&D labs, common sales forces, and common manufacturing, they are usually relatively easy to duplicate. The only duplication issues for shared activities concern developing the cooperative cross-business relationships that often facilitate the use of shared activities. Moreover, because risk reduction, tax advantages, and employee compensation motives for diversifying can be accomplished through both related and unrelated diversification, these motives for diversifying tend to be relatively easy to duplicate.\nOn the other hand, other economies of scope are much more difficult to duplicate. These difficult-to-duplicate economies of scope include core competencies, internal capital allocation efficiencies, multipoint competition, and exploitation of market power. Because core competencies are more intangible, their direct duplication is often challenging. The realization of capital allocation economies of scope requires very substantial information-processing capabilities. These capabilities are often very difficult to develop. Multipoint competition requires very close coordination between the different businesses in which a firm operates. This kind of coordination is socially complex and thus may often be immune from direct duplication. Finally, exploitation of market power may be costly to duplicate because it requires that a firm must possess significant market power in one of its lines of business. A firm that does not have this market power advantage would have to obtain it. The cost of doing so, in most situations, would be prohibitive.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 25\nLearning Obj.:  9.3: Specify the Circumstances Under Which a Firm's Diversification Strategy Will be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage (a) Explain Which of the Economies of Scope Identified in this Chapter are More Likely to be Subject to Low-Cost Imitation and Which are Less Likely to be Subject to Low-Cost Imitation (b) Identify Two Potential Substitutes for Corporate Diversification.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n97) Identify two potential substitutes for corporate diversification and discuss how each can provide benefits similar to corporate diversification.\nAnswer:  Two obvious substitutes for diversification exist. First, instead of obtaining cost or revenue advantages from exploiting economies of scope across businesses in a diversified firm, a firm may decide to simply grow and develop each of its businesses separately. In this sense, a firm that successfully implements a cost-leadership strategy or a product-differentiation strategy in a single business can obtain the same cost or revenue advantages it could have obtained by exploiting economies of scope, but without having to develop cross-business relations. Growing independent businesses within a diversified firm can be a substitute for exploiting economies of scope in a diversification strategy.\nA second substitute for exploiting economies of scope in diversification can be found in strategic alliances. By using a strategic alliance, firms may be able to gain the economies of scope they could have obtained if they had carefully exploited economies of scope across businesses they own. Thus, for example, instead of a firm exploiting research and development economies of scope between two businesses it owns, it could form a strategic alliance with a different firm and form a joint research and development lab. Instead of a firm exploiting sales economies of scope by linking its businesses through a common sales force, it might develop a sales agreement with another firm and obtain cost or revenue advantages in this way.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 26\nLearning Obj.:  9.3: Specify the Circumstances Under Which a Firm's Diversification Strategy Will be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage (a) Explain Which of the Economies of Scope Identified in this Chapter are More Likely to be Subject to Low-Cost Imitation and Which are Less Likely to be Subject to Low-Cost Imitation (b) Identify Two Potential Substitutes for Corporate Diversification.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n98) Explain how strategic alliances are a substitute for exploiting economies of scope in diversification.\nAnswer:  By using a strategic alliance, a firm may be able to gain the economies of scope it could have obtained if it had carefully exploited economies of scope across its businesses.

corporate diversification strategy.\nAnswer:  The most common organizational structure for implementing a corporate diversification strategy is the M-form, or multidivisional, structure. The M-form structure is designed to create checks and balances for managers in a firm that increase the probability that a diversified firm will be managed in ways consistent with the interests of its equity holders. In the multidivisional structure, each business that the firm engages in is managed through a division, which is treated as a true profit-and-loss center in that the profits and losses are calculated at the level of the division in these firms. Divisions in an M-form organization typically adopt a U-form structure and are large enough to represent identifiable business entities but small enough so that a division general manager can effectively manage each one.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  10.1: Describe the Multidivisional, or M-Form, Organizational Structure and the Roles of the Board of Directors, Institutional Investors, the Senior Executive, Corporate Staff, Division General Managers, and Shared Activity Managers in Making the M-Form Structure Work.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n55) Define what constitutes an agency relationship and the roles of the principal and the agent; discuss how the agency relationship is reflected in the context of corporate diversification and when the agency relationship can be effective; and identify two common agency problems.\nAnswer:  An agency relationship exists whenever one party to an exchange delegates decision-making authority to a second party. In the agency relationship, the party delegating the decision-making authority is called the agent and the party to whom the authority is delegated is called the agent. In the context of corporate diversification, an agency relationship exists between a firm's outside equity holders (as principals) and its managers (as agents) to the extent that equity holders delegate the day-to-day management of their investment to those managers. The agency relationship between equity holders and managers can be very effective as long as managers make investment decisions in ways that are consistent with equity holders' interests. Thus, if equity holders are interested in maximizing the rate of return on their investment in a firm and if managers make their investment decisions with this objective in mind, then equity holders will have few concerns about delegating the day-to-day management of their investments to managers. Unfortunately, in numerous situations the interests of a firm's outside equity holders and its managers do not coincide. When parties in an agency relationship differ in their decision-making objectives, agency problems arise. Two common agency problems have been identified:\n1. Managers can decide to take some of a firm's capital and invest it in managerial perquisites that do not add economic value to the firm but do directly benefit those managers.\n2. To the extent that very risky investments may jeopardize a firm's survival and thus management's compensation and positions, managers may be more risk averse in their decision making than equity holders would prefer them to be.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  10.1: Describe the Multidivisional, or M-Form, Organizational Structure and the Roles of the Board of Directors, Institutional Investors, the Senior Executive, Corporate Staff, Division General Managers, and Shared Activity Managers in Making the M-Form Structure Work.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n56) Describe the nature and role of the board of directors in an M-form organization and discuss who generally serves on the board, the role of outside members on a board of directors and when the roles of CEO and chairman of the board should be combined or separated.\nAnswer:  In an M-form organization, the board of director's primary responsibility is to monitor decision making in the firm to ensure that it is consistent with the interests of outside equity holders. In principle, all of a firm's senior managers report to the board. A board of directors typically consists of 10 to 15 individuals drawn from a firm's top management group and from individuals outside the firm. A firm's senior executive (often identified by the title president, chief executive officer, or CEO), its chief financial officer (CFO), and a few other senior managers are usually on the board although outsiders typically outnumber managers on the board. The firm's senior executive is often but not always the chairman of the board. The task of managerial board members, including the board chair, is to provide other board members information and insights about critical decisions being made in the firm and the effect those decisions are likely to have on a firm's equity holders. The task of outsiders on the board is to evaluate the past, current, and future performance of the firm and of its senior managers to ensure that the actions taken in the firm are consistent with equity holders' interests. Outside directors, as compared to insiders, tend to focus more on monitoring a firm's economic performance rather than other measures of firm performance. Outside board members are also more likely than inside members to dismiss CEOs following poor performance. Also, outside board members have a stronger incentive than inside members to maintain their reputation as effective monitors. This incentive by itself can lead to more effective monitoring by outside board members. Moreover, the monitoring effectiveness of outside board members seems to be substantially enhanced when they personally own a substantial amount of a firm's equity. There is currently some debate about whether the roles of board chair and CEO should be combined or separated, and if separated, what kinds of people should occupy these positions. Empirical research on this question suggests that whether the roles of CEO and chairman should be combined or not depends on the complexity of the information analysis and monitoring task facing the CEO and chairman. Some researchers have found that combining the roles of CEO and chairman is positively correlated with firm performance when firms operate in slow-growth and simple competitive environments, environments that do not overtax the cognitive capability of a single individual. This finding suggests that combining these roles does not necessarily increase conflicts between a firm and its equity holders. This research also found that separating the roles of CEO and board chair is positively correlated with firm performance when firms operate in high-growth and very complex environments. In such environments, a single individual cannot fulfill all the responsibilities of both CEO and chairman, and thus the two roles need to be held by separate individuals.\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  10.1: Describe the Multidivisional, or M-Form, Organizational Structure and the Roles of the Board of Directors, Institutional Investors, the Senior Executive, Corporate Staff, Division General Managers, and Shared Activity Managers in Making the M-Form Structure Work.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n57) Discuss the role of institutional investors in an M-form organization. In addressing this question, be sure to identify who institutional investors are and discuss trends in institutional ownership and whether institutional investors encourage managers to act in ways that are consistent with the interests of equity holders or if institutional investors are overly myopic.\nAnswer:  Institutional owners are usually pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies or other groups of individual investors that have joined together to manage their investments. In 1970, institutions owned 32 percent of the equity traded in the United States. By 1990, institutions owned 48 percent of this equity. In 2005, they owned 59% of the equity traded in the United States. Institutional investors can use their investment clout to insist that a firm's management behaves in ways consistent with the interests of equity holders. Observers who assume that institutional investors are interested more in maximizing the short-term value of their portfolios than in the long-term performance of firms in those portfolios fear that such power will force firms to make only short-term investments. Recent research in the United States and Japan, however, suggests that institutional investors are not unduly myopic. Additionally, other researchers have shown that high levels of institutional ownership leads firms to sell strategically unrelated businesses. This effect of institutional investors is enhanced if, in addition, outside directors on a firm's board have substantial equity investments in the firm.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 9\nLearning Obj.:  10.1: Describe the Multidivisional, or M-Form, Organizational Structure and the Roles of the Board of Directors, Institutional Investors, the Senior Executive, Corporate Staff, Division General Managers, and Shared Activity Managers in Making the M-Form Structure Work.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n58) Identify the responsibilities of the senior executive in an M-form organization and discuss the three different roles in the office of the president and the responsibilities of each role.\nAnswer:  The senior executive (the president or CEO) in an M-form organization has two responsibilities: strategy formulation and strategy implementation. Strategy formulation entails deciding in which set of businesses a diversified firm will operate. At the broadest level, deciding which businesses a diversified firm should operate in is equivalent to discovering and developing valuable economies of scope among a firm's current and potential businesses. If these economies of scope are also rare and costly to imitate, they can be a source of sustained competitive advantage for a diversified firm. The senior executive is uniquely positioned to discover, develop, and nurture valuable economies of scope in a diversified firm, but the senior executive in an M-form organization should involve numerous other divisional and functional managers in strategy formulation to ensure complete and accurate information as input to the process and a broad understanding of and commitment to that strategy once it has been formulated. Strategy implementation focuses on encouraging behavior in a firm that is consistent with this strategy and almost always involves resolving conflicts within and between each of the major managerial components of the M-form structure: corporate staff, division general managers, and shared activity managers. It is often the case that the roles and responsibilities of the senior executive in an M-form organization are greater than what can be reasonably managed by a single individual. This is especially likely if a firm is broadly diversified across numerous complex products and markets. In this situation, it is not uncommon for the tasks of the senior executive to be divided among two or three people: the chairman of the board (responsible for the supervision of the board of directors in its monitoring role), the chief executive officer (responsible for strategy formulation), and the chief operating officer (responsible for strategy implementation). Together, these roles are known as the office of the president.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 10\nLearning Obj.:  10.1: Describe the Multidivisional, or M-Form, Organizational Structure and the Roles of the Board of Directors, Institutional Investors, the Senior Executive, Corporate Staff, Division General Managers, and Shared Activity Managers in Making the M-Form Structure Work.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n59) Discuss the role of division general managers in an M-form organization and compare and contrast this role with that of senior executives in U-form organizations.\nAnswer:  Division general managers in an M-form organization have primary responsibility for managing the day-to-day operations of a firm's businesses. Division general managers have full profit-and-loss responsibility and typically have multiple functional managers reporting to them. As general managers, they have both strategy formulation and strategy implementation responsibilities. On the strategy formulation side, division general managers choose strategies for their divisions within the broader strategic context established by the senior executive of the firm.\nThe strategy implementation responsibilities of division general managers in an M-form organization parallel the strategy implementation responsibilities of senior executives in U-form organizations. In particular, division general managers must be able to coordinate the activities of often conflicting functional managers in order to implement a division's strategies.\nIn addition to their responsibilities as a U-form senior executive, division general managers in an M-form organization have two additional responsibilities: to compete for corporate capital and to cooperate with other divisions to exploit corporate economies of scope. Division general managers compete for corporate capital by promising high rates of return on capital invested in previous periods by the corporations in their business. In most firms, divisions that have demonstrated the ability to generate high rates of return on earlier capital investments gain access to more capital, or to lower-cost capital, compared to divisions that have not demonstrated a history of such performance.\nDivision general managers cooperate to exploit economies of scope by working with shared activity managers, corporate staff managers, and the senior executive in the firm to isolate, understand, and use the economies of scope around which the diversified firm was originally organized. Division general managers can even become involved in discovering new economies of scope that were not anticipated when the firm's diversification strategy was originally implemented but nevertheless may be both valuable and costly for outside investors to create on their own.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 13\nLearning Obj.:  10.1: Describe the Multidivisional, or M-Form, Organizational Structure and the

of divisional performance, identify three different standards of comparison that can be used when evaluating the accounting performance of a division along with the strengths and weaknesses of each standard, and describe the potential weaknesses of accounting measures of divisional performance.\nAnswer:  Common accounting measures of divisional performance include the return on the assets controlled by a division, the return on a division's sales, and a division's sales growth. These accounting measures of divisional performance are then compared with some standard to see if a division's performance exceeds or falls short of that standard. Diversified firms use three different standards of comparison when evaluating the performance of a division: (1) a hurdle rate that is common across all the different business units in a firm, (2) a division's budgeted level of performance (which may vary by division), and (3) the average level of profitability of firms in a division's industry.\nEach of these standards of comparison has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, if a corporation has a single hurdle rate of profitability that all divisions must meet or exceed, there is little ambiguity about the performance objectives of divisions. On the other hand, such a single standard ignores important differences in performance that might exist across divisions. Comparing a division's actual performance to its budgeted performance allows the performance expectations of different divisions to vary, but the budgeting process is time consuming and fraught with political intrigue. Finally, while comparing a division's performance with the average level of profitability of firms in a division's industry also allows performance expectations to vary across divisions within a diversified firm, this approach lets other firms determine what is and is not excellent performance for a division within a diversified firm. This approach can also be manipulated: By choosing just the \"right\" firms with which to compare a division's performance, almost any division can be made to look like it's performing better than its industry average.\nNo matter what standard of comparison is used to evaluate a division's accounting performance, most accounting measures of divisional performance have a common limitation. All these measures have a short-term bias. This short-term bias reflects the fact that all these measures treat investments in resources and capabilities that have the potential for generating value in the long run and costs during a particular year.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 16\nLearning Obj.:  10.2: Describe How Three Management Control Processes?Measuring Divisional Performance, Allocating Corporate Capital, and Transferring Intermediate Products?are used to Help Implement a Corporate Diversification Strategy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n91) Discuss the relationship between accounting methods of measuring divisional performance and economic methods, identify the formula used for calculating economic value added, and discuss methods for adjusting accounting earnings and the importance of making these adjustments.\nAnswer:  Economic methods build on accounting methods but adjust those methods to incorporate short-term investments that may generate long-term benefits. Economic methods also compare a division's performance with a firm's cost of capital. This avoids some of the gaming that can characterize the use of other standards of comparison in applying accounting measures of divisional performance.\nPerhaps the most popular of these economically oriented measures of division performance is known as economic value added or EVA. EVA is calculated by subtracting the cost of capital employed in a division from that division's earnings in the following manner:\nEVA = adjusted accounting earnings - (weighted average cost of capital \ufffd\ufffd total capital employed by a division)\nThe calculation of economic value added begins with a division's \"adjusted\" accounting earnings. These are a division's traditional accounting earnings adjusted so that they approximate what would be a division's economic earnings. Several adjustments to a division's accounting statements have been described in the literature. For example, traditional accounting practices require R&D spending to be deducted each year from a division's earnings. This can lead division general managers to underinvest in longer-term R&D efforts. In the EVA measure of divisional performance, R&D spending is added back into a division's performance and R&D is then treated as an asset and depreciated over some period of time. By adjusting a division's earnings and accounting for the cost of investing in a division, economic value added is a much more accurate estimate of a division's economic performance than are traditional accounting measures of performance.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 17\nLearning Obj.:  10.2: Describe How Three Management Control Processes?Measuring Divisional Performance, Allocating Corporate Capital, and Transferring Intermediate Products?are used to Help Implement a Corporate Diversification Strategy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n92) Discuss the role of transfer pricing systems in an M-form organization, identify difficulties with setting optimal prices, and identify four alternative transfer pricing schemes.\nAnswer:  The transfer of intermediate products or services produced in one division that are used as inputs for products or services produced by a second division of a multidivisional firm is usually managed through a transfer-pricing system in which one division \"sells\" its product or service to a second division for a transfer price. Unlike a market price, which is typically determined by market forces of supply and demand, transfer prices are set by a firm's corporate management to accomplish corporate objectives.\nFrom an economic point of view, the rule for establishing the optimal transfer price in a diversified firm is quite simple: The transfer price should be the value of the opportunities forgone when one division's product or service is transferred to another division. Setting transfer prices equal to opportunity costs sounds simple enough, but it is very difficult to do in real diversified firms. Establishing optimal transfer prices requires information about the value of the opportunities forgone by the \"selling\" division. This, in turn, requires information about this division's marginal costs, its manufacturing capacity, external demand for its products, and so forth. Much of this information is difficult to calculate. Moreover, it is rarely stable. As market conditions change, demand for a division's products can change, marginal costs can change, and the value of opportunities forgone can change. Also, to the extent that a selling division customizes the products or services it transfers to other divisions in a diversified firm, the value of the opportunities forgone by this selling division become even more difficult to calculate.\nEven if this information could be obtained and updated rapidly, division general managers in selling divisions have strong incentives to manipulate the information in ways that increase the perceived value of the opportunities forgone by their division. These division general managers can thus increase the transfer price for the products or services they sell to internal customers and thereby appropriate for themselves profits that should have been allocated to buying divisions.\nFour alternative transfer pricing schemes that firms use in practice:\n? Exchange autonomy in which buying and selling division general managers are free to negotiate transfer price without corporate involvement and the transfer price is set equal to the selling division's price to external customers.\n? Mandated full cost in which the transfer price is set equal to the selling division's actual cost of product or to the selling division's standard cost.\n? Mandated market price in which the transfer price is set equal to the market price in the selling division's market.\n? Dual pricing in which the transfer price for the buying division is set equal to the selling division's actual or standard costs and the transfer price for the selling division is equal to the price to external customers or the market price in the selling division's market.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 20\nLearning Obj.:  10.2: Describe How Three Management Control Processes?Measuring Divisional Performance, Allocating Corporate Capital, and Transferring Intermediate Products?are used to Help Implement a Corporate Diversification Strategy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n93) Which of the following statements regarding CEO compensation is accurate?\nA) Differences in CEO cash compensation are very responsive to differences in firm performance.\nB) If a substantial percentage of a CEO's compensation comes in the form of stock and stock options in the firm, changes in compensation are closely linked with changes in firm performance.\nC) If a substantial percentage of a CEO's compensation comes in the form of stock and stock options in the firm, changes in compensation are not closely linked with changes in firm performance.\nD) If a substantial percentage of a CEO's compensation comes in the form of salary, changes in compensation can be expected to be closely linked with changes in firm performance.\nAnswer:  B\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 23\nLearning Obj.:  10.3: Describe the Role of Management Compensation in Helping to Implement a Corporate Diversification Strategy.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\nSpandoCorp is a diversified firm that makes industrial, military and consumer products from Spandex.

To the extent that compensation in diversified firms gives managers incentives to make decisions consistent with stockholder's interests, they can be an important part of the process of implementing corporate diversification. Traditionally, the compensation of corporate managers in a diversified firm has been only loosely connected to the firm's economic performance. Research indicates that differences in CEO cash compensation (salary plus cash bonus) are not very responsive to differences in firm performance but if a substantial percentage of a CEO's compensation came in the form of stock and stock options in the firm, changes in compensation would be closely linked with changes in the firm performance. These and similar findings reported elsewhere have led more and more diversified firms to include stock and stock options as part of the compensation package for the CEO to more closely align the interests of the CEO with those of stockholders.\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 23\nLearning Obj.:  10.3: Describe the Role of Management Compensation in Helping to Implement a Corporate Diversification

can create economic value by helping firms improve the performance of their current operations.\nAnswer:  One way that firms can use strategic alliances to improve their current operations is to use alliances to realize economies of scale. To realize economies of scale, firms have to have a large volume of production, or at least a volume of production large enough so that the cost advantages associated with scale can be realized. When a firm cannot realize the cost savings from economies of scale all by itself, it may join in a strategic alliance with other firms. Jointly, these firms may have sufficient volume to be able to gain the cost advantages of economies of scale. \nFirms can also use alliances to improve their current operations by learning from their competitors. Different firms in an industry may have different resources and capabilities and these resources can give some firms competitive advantages over other firms. Firms that are at a competitive disadvantage may want to form alliances with the firms that have an advantage in order to learn about their resources and capabilities.\nFinally, firms can use alliances to improve their current operations through sharing costs and risks. This is especially valuable when the future state of the environment or the growth rate of the industry is uncertain.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances can Create Value for Firms.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n42) Discuss the concept of a learning race and identify three reasons why firms in an alliance may differ in the rate they learn from each other.\nAnswer:  A learning race exists in a strategic alliance when both parties to that alliance seek to learn from each other but when the rate at which these two firms learn varies. In this setting, the first firm to learn what it wants to learn from an alliance has the option to begin to underinvest in, and perhaps even withdraw from, an alliance. In this way, the firm that learns the fastest is able to prevent the slow-learning firm from learning all it wanted from an alliance. There are a variety of reasons why firms in an alliance may vary in the rate they learn from each other. First, they may be looking to learn different things, and some things are easier to learn than others. Second, firms may differ in terms of their ability to learn or their absorptive capacity. Firms with high levels of absorptive capacity will learn at higher rates than firms with low levels of absorptive capacity, even if these two firms are trying to learn exactly the same things in an alliance. Third, firms can engage in activities such as withholding information necessary to exploit technology in an alliance or withholding critical employees from an alliance to try to slow the rate of learning of their alliance partners.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 6\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances can Create Value for Firms.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n43) What is the connection between strategic alliances and real options?\nAnswer:  Real options are options that are embedded in certain decisions that a firm makes. A joint venture (which is a form of strategic alliance) is an option that a firm buys under conditions of uncertainty to retain the ability to move quickly into a market or industry if valuable opportunities present themselves. Thus, firms in new and uncertain environments develop numerous strategic alliances that they treat as real options.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances

cheating in strategic alliances and discuss the short- and long-term implications of cheating in a strategic alliance.\nAnswer:  The three ways to cheat in strategic alliances are adverse selection, moral hazard and holdup. Adverse selection occurs when potential partners misrepresent the value of the skills and abilities they bring to an alliance. In general, the less tangible the resources and capabilities that are to be brought to a strategic alliance, the more costly it will be to estimate their value before an alliance is created and the more likely is adverse selection to occur. Moral hazard occurs when partners provide to the alliance skills and capabilities of lower quality than they promised. Finally, holdup occurs when a firm that has not made significant transaction-specific investments demands from an alliance returns that are higher than what the partners agreed to when they created the alliance. In the short-run, firms that cheat on their alliance partners can gain some advantages. But research suggests that cheating does not pay in the long run. In the long run, firms that cheat on their alliance partners find it difficult to form alliances with new partners and thus have many valuable exchange opportunities foreclosed to them.\nDiff: 2

discuss the role that complementary resources can play in the rarity of strategic alliances.\nAnswer:  The rarity of strategic alliances depends both on the number of competing firms that have already implemented an alliance and whether or not the benefits that firms obtain from their alliances are not common across firms competing in an industry. One of the reasons why the benefits that accrue from a particular strategic alliance may be rare is that relatively few firms may have the complementary resources and abilities needed to form an alliance. This is particularly likely when an alliance is formed to enter into a new market and especially a new foreign market. In many less developed economies, only one local firm or a very few local firms may exist with the local knowledge, contacts, and distribution network needed to facilitate entry into that market. Moreover, sometimes the government acts to limit the number of these local firms. Although several firms may seek entry into this market, only a very small number will be able to form a strategic alliance with the local entity and therefore the benefits that accrue to the allied firms will likely be rare.\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 16\nLearning Obj.:  11.4: Describe the Conditions Under which a Strategic Alliance can be Rare and Costly to Duplicate.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n84) Discuss when strategic alliances may be costly to directly duplicate.\nAnswer:  To the extent that a strategic alliance goes well beyond simple legal contracts and is characterized by socially complex phenomena such as a trusting relationship between alliance partners, friendship, and even (perhaps) a willingness to suspend narrow self-interest for the longer-term good of the relationship, it will be costly for other firms to directly duplicate. Additionally, to the extent that the organizational and relationship-building skills required for successful alliance building are rare among a set of competing firms and costly to develop, strategic alliances will be costly to duplicate and firms that are able to exploit these abilities by creating alliances may gain competitive advantages.\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 17\nLearning Obj.:  11.4: Describe the Conditions Under which a Strategic Alliance can be Rare and Costly to Duplicate.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n85) Discuss when firms go it alone and identify three conditions under which alliances will be preferred to going it alone and when going it alone is not an attractive substitute for an alliance.\nAnswer:  Firms go it alone when they attempt to develop all the resources and capabilities they need to exploit market opportunities and neutralize market threats by themselves. Sometimes, going it alone can create the same, or even more, value than using alliances to exploit opportunities and neutralize threats. In these settings, going it alone is a substitute for a strategic alliance. However, in other settings, using an alliance can create substantially more value than going it alone. In these settings, going it alone is not a substitute for a strategic alliance. In general, alliances will be preferred to going it alone when\n1. The level of transaction-specific investment required to complex an exchange is moderate.\n2. An exchange partner possesses valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources and capabilities.\n3.

In this case, rather than developing a strategic alliance or attempting to develop and exploit the relevant resources by going it alone, a firm seeking to exploit opportunities may simply acquire another firm that already possesses the relevant resources and capabilities. The four conditions under which alliances will be preferred to acquisitions are:\n1. There are legal constraints on acquisitions.\n2. Acquisitions limit a firm's flexibility under conditions of high uncertainty.\n3. There is substantial unwanted organizational \"baggage\" in an acquired firm.\n4.

Thinking\n\n98) Describe five tools that firms can use to reduce the threat of cheating in strategic alliances.\nAnswer:  The five tools firms can use to reduce the threat of cheating in strategic alliances are contracts, equity investments, firm reputations, joint ventures, and trust.\nContracts. One way to avoid cheating in strategic alliances is for parties to an alliance to anticipate the ways in which cheating may occur (including adverse selection, moral hazard, and holdup) and to write explicit contracts that define legal liability if cheating does occur. Writing these contracts, together with the close monitoring of contractual compliance and the threat of legal sanctions, can reduce the probability of cheating.\nEquity investments. The effectiveness of contracts can be enhanced by having partners in an alliance make equity investments in each other so that if one of the partners to an alliance cheats, they will be negatively impacted through their equity investment in their partner.\nFirm reputations. Information about an alliance partner that has cheated is likely to become widely known. A firm with a reputation as a cheater is not likely to be able to develop strategic alliances with other partners in the future, despite any special resources or capabilities that it might be able to bring to an alliance. In this way, cheating in a current alliance may foreclose opportunities for developing valuable alliances. For this reason, firms may decide not to cheat in their current alliances.\nJoint ventures. Creating a separate legal entity in which alliance partners invest and from whose profits they earn returns on their investments reduces some of the risks of cheating in strategic alliances. When a joint venture is created, the ability of partners to earn returns on their investments depends on the economic success of the joint venture. Partners in joint ventures have limited interests in behaving in ways that hurt the performance of the joint venture because such behaviors end up hurting themselves. Moreover, unlike reputational consequences of cheating, cheating in a joint venture does not just foreclose future alliance opportunities, it can hurt the cheating firm in the current period as well.\nTrust. Trust, in combination with contracts, can help reduce the threat of cheating. More important, trust may enable partners to explore exchange opportunities that they could not explore if only legal and economic organizing mechanisms were in place.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 20\nLearning Obj.:  11.5: Describe How Contracts, Equity Investments, Firm Reputations, Joint Ventures, and Trust can All Reduce the Threat of Cheating in Strategic Alliances.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking",12:"Strategic Management and Competitive Advantage, 6e (Barney)\nChapter 12   Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n1) A firm engages in a(n) ________ when it purchases a second firm.\nA) acquisition\nB) joint venture\nC) strategic alliance\nD) equity alliance\nAnswer:  A\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  12.1: Describe Different Types of Mergers and Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n2) When one firm acquires a(n) ________ of another firm, it has acquired enough of that firm's assets so that the acquiring firm is able to make all the management and strategic decisions in the target firm.\nA) market stake\nB) equity share\nC) controlling share\nD) equity stake\nAnswer:  C\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  12.1: Describe Different Types of Mergers and Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n3) A(n) ________ acquisition occurs when the management of a target firm wants to be acquired.\nA) hostile\nB) admirable\nC) strategic\nD) friendly\nAnswer:  D\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  12.1: Describe Different Types of Mergers and Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n4) When a firm has not sold shares on the public stock market, it is known as\nA) closely held.\nB) privately held.\nC) publicly traded.\nD) a small cap stock.\nAnswer:  B\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  12.1: Describe Different Types of Mergers and Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n5) The difference between the current market price of a target firm's shares and the price a potential acquirer offers to pay for those shares is known as an\nA) acquisition premium.\nB) acquisition discount.\nC) acquisition margin.\nD) acquisition price.\nAnswer:  A\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  12.1: Describe Different Types of Mergers and Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n6) When Sears and Kmart, two retail firms of relatively equal size in the United States, agreed to combine their assets, this was an example of a(n)\nA) joint venture.\nB) acquisition.\nC) merger.\nD) equity agreement.\nAnswer:  C\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 6\nLearning Obj.:  12.1: Describe Different Types of Mergers and Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Application of Knowledge\n\nP&G is a leading consumer goods company in the United States that has grown its business through a combination of international growth, alliances, acquisitions and mergers.

An acquiring firm can use cash it has generated from its ongoing businesses to purchase a target firm, it can go into debt to purchase a target firm, it can use its own equity to purchase a target firm, or it can use a mix of these mechanisms to purchase a target firm. Also, an acquiring firm can purchase all of a target firm's assets, it can purchase a majority of those assets (greater than 51%), or it can purchase a controlling share of those assets (i.e., enough assets so that the acquiring firm is able to make all the management and strategic decisions in the target firm). Acquisitions can be friendly (when the management of the target firm wants to be acquired) or unfriendly (when the management of the target firm does not want to be acquired). Some unfriendly acquisitions are also known as hostile takeovers. When the assets of two similar-sized firms are combined, this transaction is called a merger.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  12.1: Describe Different Types of Mergers and

current market value of $25,000, identify the economic profits that will be earned by both the bidding firm's equity holders and the target firm's equity holders and discuss this case.\nAnswer:  The economic value created for both the target firm and the bidding firm will be zero. The value for the bidding firm will be zero because the value of any one of the bidding firms when combined with the target firm exactly equals the sum of the value of these firms as separate entities. The price of this acquisition will quickly rise to $25,000 because any bid less than $25,000 will generate economic profits for a successful bidder that will, in turn, generate entry into a bidding war for a target. Therefore, the price will quickly rise to its value, and economic profits will not be created. Alternately, the target firm's equity holders will also gain zero economic profits since the market value of the target firm has not been increased; it has only been capitalized in the form of a cash payment from the bidder to the target. The target was worth $25,000 and that is exactly what these equity holders will receive.\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 6\nLearning Obj.:  12.2: Describe How Mergers and Acquisitions can Create Economic Value (a) When Bidding and Target Firms Share no Economies of Scope (b) When Bidding and Target Firms Share Economies of Scope (c) and Why Firms Might Engage in these Strategies Even When, on Average, They do Not Create Profits for Bidding Firms.\nAACSB:  Application of Knowledge\n\n66) Identify and differentiate between the five different FTC categories of mergers and acquisitions.\nAnswer:  The five different FTC categories of mergers and acquisitions are vertical merger, horizontal merger, product extension merger, market extension merger, and conglomerate merger. A vertical merger occurs when a firm acquires former suppliers or customers. In a horizontal merger, a firm acquires a former competitor. A product extension merger occurs when a firm gains access to complementary products through an acquisition. In a market extension merger, a firm gains access to complementary markets though an acquisition. Finally, in a conglomerate merger, there is no strategic relatedness between a bidding firm and a target firm.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 8\nLearning Obj.:  12.2: Describe How Mergers and Acquisitions can Create Economic Value (a) When Bidding and Target Firms Share no Economies of Scope (b) When Bidding and Target Firms Share Economies of Scope (c) and Why Firms Might Engage in these Strategies Even When, on Average, They do Not Create Profits for Bidding Firms.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n67) Identify the three potential sources of strategic relatedness between bidding and target firms that were detailed by Lubatkin in 1983 and the four general reasons why bidding firms might want to engage in merger and acquisitions as detailed by Jensen and Ruback in 1983.\nAnswer:  The three potential sources of strategic relatedness between bidding and target firms that Lubatkin identified in 1983 are:\n? Technical economies, which are scale economies that occur when the physical processes inside a firm are altered so that the same amounts of input produce a higher quantity of outputs.\n? Pecuniary economies that are achieved by the ability of firms to dictate prices by exerting market power.\n? Diversification economies that are achieved by improving a firm's performance relative to its risk attributes or lowering its risk attributes to its performance.\nThe four general reasons that bidding firms might want to engage in merger and acquisitions as detailed by Jensen and Ruback in 1983 are:\n? To reduce production or distribution costs.\n? To pursue financial motivations such as gaining access to underutilized tax shields, avoiding bankruptcy costs, to increase leverage opportunities, and to gain other tax advantages.\n? To gain market power in product markets.\n? To eliminate inefficient management in the target firm.\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 9\nLearning Obj.:  12.2: Describe How Mergers and Acquisitions can Create Economic Value (a) When Bidding and Target Firms Share no Economies of Scope (b) When Bidding and Target Firms Share Economies of Scope (c) and Why Firms Might Engage in these Strategies Even When, on Average, They do Not Create Profits for Bidding Firms.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n68) If there is one target firm with a current market value of $20,000 as a stand-alone entity and five bidding firms, each of which has a current market value of $30,000 as a stand-alone entity, and the value of the target firms and any of the bidding firms combined is $60,000, estimate the price the bidding firms would be willing to pay for the target firm and the return to stockholders of bidding and target firms when there is strategic relatedness between firms.\nAnswer:  If bidding and target firms are strategically related, then the economic value of these two firms combined is greater than the economic value of these two firms as separate entities. The market value of the target firm as a stand-alone entity is $20,000, and the market value of the bidding firms as stand-alone entities is $30,000. The value of any of the bidding firms and the target combined is $60,000. Bidding firms will be willing to pay a price for a target up to the value that a target firm adds once it is acquired. Thus, the maximum price bidding firms are willing to pay is still the difference between the value of the combined entity (here, $60,000) and the value of a bidding firm on its own (here, $30,000). \nThe price for actually acquiring the target firm in this scenario will rapidly rise to $30,000 because any bid less than $30,000 has the potential for generating profits for a bidding firm. At this $30,000 price, the successful bidding firm earns zero economic profits. After all, this firm has acquired an asset that will generate $30,000 of value and has paid $30,000 to do so. However, the owners of the target firm will earn an economic profit worth $10,000. As a stand-alone firm, the target is worth $20,000; when combined with a bidding firm, it is worth $30,000. The difference between the value of the target as a stand-alone entity and its value in combination with a bidding firm is the value of the economic profit ($10,000) that can be appropriated by the owners of the target firm.\nThus, the existence of strategic relatedness between bidding and target firms is not a sufficient condition for the equity holders of bidding firms to earn economic profits from their acquisition strategies. If the economic potential of acquiring a particular target firm is widely known and if several potential bidding firms can all obtain this value by acquiring a target, the equity holders of bidding firms will, at best, earn only zero economic profits from implementing an acquisition strategy. In this setting, a \"strategically related\" merger or acquisition will create economic value, but this value will be distributed in the form of economic profits to the equity holders of acquired target firms.\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  12.2: Describe How Mergers and Acquisitions can Create Economic Value (a) When Bidding and Target Firms Share no Economies of Scope (b) When Bidding and Target Firms Share Economies of Scope (c) and Why Firms Might Engage in these Strategies Even When, on Average, They do Not Create Profits for Bidding Firms.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking, Application of Knowledge\n\n\n69) Describe and discuss five reasons why bidding firms might still engage in acquisitions even if, on average, they do not create value for a bidding firm's stockholders.\nAnswer:  The five possible motivations to engage in mergers and acquisitions even though they do not generate profits for bidding firms are to ensure survival, to invest free cash flow, agency problems, managerial hubris, and the potential for above-normal profits.\nTo ensure survival. Even if mergers and acquisitions, on average, generate only zero economic profits for bidding firms, it may be necessary for bidding firms to engage in these activities to ensure their survival. In particular, if all of a bidding firm's competitors have been able to improve their efficiency and effectiveness through a particular type of acquisition, then failing to make such an acquisition may put a firm at a competitive disadvantage. Here, the purpose of a merger or acquisition is not to gain competitive advantages but rather to gain competitive parity.\nTo invest free cash flow. Free cash flow is simply the amount of cash a firm has to invest after all positive net present-value investments in a firm's ongoing businesses have been funded. Free cash flow is created when a firm's ongoing business operations are very profitable but offer few opportunities for additional investment. In this context, merger and acquisition strategies are a viable option as bidding firms, on average, can expect to generate at least competitive parity. Put differently, while mergers and acquisitions may not be a source of superior profits, there are worse things a firm could do with its free cash flow.\nAgency problems. Another reason why firms might continue to engage in mergers and acquisitions despite earning only competitive parity from doing so is that mergers and acquisitions benefit managers directly, independent of any value they may or may not create for a bidding firm's stockholders. Merger and acquisition strategies can benefit managers, even if they do not directly benefit a bidding firm's equity holders, in at least two ways. First, managers can use mergers and acquisitions to help diversify their human capital investments in their firm. Second, managers can use mergers and acquisitions to quickly increase firm size, measured in either sales or assets. If management compensation is closely linked to firm size, managers who increase firm size are able to increase their compensation.\nManagerial hubris. Managers can fall victim to managerial hubris, or the unrealistic belief held by managers in bidding firms that they can manage the assets of a target firm more efficiently than can the target firm's current management. This notion can lead bidding firms to engage in acquisition strategies even though there may not be positive economic profits from doing so.\nThe potential for above-normal profits. A final reason why managers might continue to pursue merger and acquisition strategies is the potential that these strategies offer for generating profits for at least some bidding firms. The empirical research on returns to bidding firms in mergers and acquisitions is very strong. On average, bidding firms do not gain profits from their merger and acquisition strategies. However, just because bidding firms, on average, do not earn profits on these strategies does not mean that all bidding firms will always fail to earn profits. In some situations, bidding firms may be able to gain competitive advantages from merger and acquisition activities.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 13\nLearning Obj.:  12.2: Describe How Mergers and

These rules are:\n? Search for valuable and rare economies of scope. Bidding firms should seek to acquire targets with which they enjoy valuable and rare linkages. Operationally, the search for rare economies of scope suggests that managers in bidding firms need to consider not only the value of a target firm when combined with their own company, but also the value of a target firm when combined with other potential bidders. This is important because it is the difference between the value of a particular bidding firm's relationship with a target and the value of other bidding firms' relationships with that target that defines the size of the potential economic profits from an acquisition.\n? Keep information away from bidders. One of the keys to earning superior performance in an acquisition strategy is to avoid multiple bidders for a single target. One way to accomplish this is to keep information about the bidding process, and about the sources of economies of scope between a bidder and target that underlie this bidding process, as private as possible.\n? Keep information away from targets. Unless it is illegal to do so, bidding firms must not fully reveal the value of their economies of scope with a target firm.\n? Avoid winning bidding wars. If a number of firms bid for the same target, the probability that the firm that successfully acquires the target will gain competitive advantages is very low. Therefore, it is to a bidding firm's advantage to avoid a bidding war.\n? Close the deal quickly. All the economic processes that make it difficult for bidding firms to earn economic profits from acquiring a strategically related target take time to unfold. It takes time for other bidders to become aware of the economic value associated with acquiring a target; it takes time for the target to recruit other bidders; information leakage becomes more of a problem over time; and so forth. A bidding firm that begins and ends the bidding process quickly may forestall some of these processes and thereby retain some superior performance for itself from an acquisition.\n? Operate in thinly traded acquisitions markets. A thinly traded market is a market where there is only a small number of buyers and sellers, where information about opportunities in this market is not widely known, and where interests besides purely maximizing the value of a firm can be important. In the context of mergers and acquisitions, thinly traded markets are markets where only a few (often only one) firms are implementing acquisition strategies. These unique firms may be the only firms that understand the full value of the acquisition opportunities in this market. Even target firm managers may not fully understand the value of the economic opportunities in these markets, and even if they do, they may have other interests besides maximizing the value of their firm if it becomes the object of a takeover.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  12.3: Describe Three Ways that Bidding Firms Might be able to Generate Economic Profits from Implementing Mergers or Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n90) Identify and discuss the three rules that target firm managers should follow to maximize the probability of earning economic profits from their merger and acquisition strategies.\nAnswer:  The three rules that managers of target firms should follow to maximize the probability of earning economic profits from their merger and acquisition strategies are:\n? Seek information from bidders. Target firms must inform themselves about the resources and capabilities of current and potential bidders. In this way, target firms can become fully aware of the value that they hold for bidders, and they are more likely to be able to extract this full value in the acquisition process.\n? Invite other bidders to join the bidding competition. Once a target firm is fully aware of the nature and value of the economies of scope that exist between it and current bidding firms, it can exploit this information by seeking other firms that may have the same relationship with it and then informing these firms of a potential acquisition opportunity. By inviting other firms into the bidding process, the target firm increases the competitiveness of the market for corporate control, thereby increasing the probability that the value by an acquisition will be fully captured by the target firm.\n? Delay but do not stop the acquisition. To increase the probability of receiving more than one bid, target firms have a strong incentive to delay an acquisition. The objective, however, should be to delay an acquisition to create a more competitive market for corporate control, not to stop an acquisition.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 22\nLearning Obj.:  12.3: Describe Three Ways that Bidding Firms Might be able to Generate Economic Profits from Implementing Mergers or Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n91) Describe three major challenges that firms integrating acquisitions are likely to face.\nAnswer:  Although, in general, organizing to implement merger and acquisition strategies can be seen as a special case of organizing to implement corporate diversification strategies or vertical integration strategies, implementing merger and acquisition strategies can create special problems. Most of these problems reflect the fact that operational, functional, strategic, and cultural differences between bidding and target firms involved in a merger or acquisition are likely to be much greater than these same differences between the different parts of a diversified or vertically integrated business that was not created through acquisition. The reason for this difference is that the firms involved in a merger or acquisition have had a separate existences, separate histories, separate management philosophies, and separate strategies.\nOne of the most significant challenges in integrating bidding and target firms has to do with cultural differences. Simply because a firm has been acquired does not mean that the culture in that firm will rapidly change to become more like the culture of the bidding firm. Indeed, cultural conflicts can last for very long periods of time. For example, the difference between the relative success of Renault's acquisition of Nissan and Daimler-Chrysler's acquisition of Mitsubishi discussed in the opening case of this chapter has largely been attributed to the inability of Mitsubishi to modify its traditional management culture.\nOperational, functional, strategic, and cultural differences between bidding and target firms can all be compounded by the merger and acquisition process especially if that process was unfriendly. Unfriendly takeovers can generate in target firm management anger and animosity toward the management of the bidding firm. Research has shown that top management turnover is much higher in firms that have been taken over compared to firms not subject to takeovers, reflecting one approach to resolving these management conflicts.\nThe difficulties often associated with organizing to implement a merger and acquisition strategy can be thought of as an additional cost of the acquisition process. Bidding firms, in addition to estimating the value of the strategic relatedness between themselves and a target firm, also need to estimate the cost of organizing to implement an acquisition. The value that a target firm brings to a bidding firm through an acquisition should be discounted by the cost of organizing to implement this strategy. In some circumstances, it may be the case that the cost of organizing to realize the value of strategic relatedness between a bidding firm and a target may be greater than the value of that strategic relatedness, in which case the acquisition should not occur. For this reason, many observers argue that potential economies of scope between bidding and target firms are often not fully realized.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 27\nLearning Obj.:  12.3: Describe Three Ways that Bidding Firms Might be able to Generate Economic Profits from Implementing Mergers or Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n92) How are poison pills different from shark repellents?\nAnswer:  Both poison pills and shark repellents are mechanisms available to target firms to prevent being taken over. Poison pills include a variety of actions that target firm managers can take to make the acquisition of the target prohibitively expensive. One example of a poison pill is when the target firm issues rights to its current stockholders indicating that if the firm is acquired in an unfriendly takeover, it will distribute a special cash dividend to its stockholders. This cash dividend effectively increases the cost of the acquisition, thereby making it less attractive to the bidding firm.\nIn contrast, shark repellents are a variety of relatively minor corporate governance changes that, in principle, are supposed to make it somewhat more difficult to acquire a target firm. An example would be the supermajority voting rule, in which more than 50 percent of the target firm's board of directors must approve the takeover.\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 25\nLearning Obj.:  12.3: Describe Three Ways that Bidding Firms Might be able to Generate Economic Profits from Implementing Mergers or Acquisitions.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n93) Mergers and acquisitions used to create diversification strategies should be managed through the\nA) M-form structure.\nB) functional structure.\nC) U-form structure.\nD) matrix structure.\nAnswer:  A\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 27\nLearning Obj.:  12.4: Describe the Major Challenges that Firms Integrating Acquisitions are Likely to Face.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n94) The most significant challenge in integrating bidding and target firms has to do with\nA) accounting differences.\nB) cultural differences.\nC) operational differences.\nD) logistic differences.\nAnswer:  B\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 27\nLearning Obj.:  12.4: Describe the Major Challenges that Firms Integrating Acquisitions are Likely to Face.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\nP&G is a leading consumer goods company in the United States that has grown its business through a combination of international growth, alliances, acquisitions and mergers.
