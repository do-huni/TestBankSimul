The company manufactures its own GPS units, which are smaller than those of any other competitor and include a proprietary battery that lasts 200% longer than any other competitor's battery and that TerraLoc manufacturers on-site. TerraLoc also has developed proprietary software that is much faster and more precise than that of any competitor. When developing the proprietary battery, TerraLoc decided to manufacturer the battery in-house to reduce the possibility that the company it outsourced the battery manufacturing to might reverse engineer the battery and sell a similar product to competitors. This possibility was especially troubling given that the company expected a significant increase in demand due to the improved battery life. Additionally, TerraLoc sells its products and services through its own direct sales force to ensure that its representatives highlight the longer battery life of TerraLoc's units.\n\n14) If TerraLoc wanted to expand into selling its GPS units through company-owned retail stores, this would be an example of ________.\nA) forward vertical integration\nB) backward vertical integration\nC) opportunism\nD) a joint venture\nAnswer:  A\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Application of Knowledge\n\n15) A firm's level of vertical integration is the number of steps in its value chain that the firm accomplishes within its boundaries.\nAnswer:  TRUE\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n16) More vertically integrated firms accomplish fewer stages of the value chain within their boundaries than less vertically integrated firms.\nAnswer:  FALSE\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n17) A firm engages in backward vertical integration when it incorporates more stages of the value chain within its boundaries and those stages bring it closer to gaining access to raw materials.\nAnswer:  TRUE\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n18) If Wal-Mart were to purchase a factory to make socks and it planned to sell these socks in its stores, this would be an example of forward vertical integration.\nAnswer:  FALSE\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Application of Knowledge\n\n19) When companies developed their own software in the United States, they were engaging in backward vertical integration, but when they started using independent companies in India to develop these software, they were more vertically integrated.\nAnswer:  FALSE\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Application of Knowledge\n\n20) A firm with a high ratio between value added and sales has brought many of the value-creating activities associated with its business inside its boundaries, consistent with a high level of vertical integration.\nAnswer:  TRUE\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 6\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n21) Define vertical integration and differentiate between forward vertical integration and backward vertical integration.\nAnswer:  Vertical integration is a corporate strategy. A firm's level of vertical integration is simply the number of steps in this value chain that a firm accomplishes within its boundaries. More vertically integrated firms accomplish more stages of the value chain within their boundaries than less vertically integrated firms. Less vertically integrated firms accomplish fewer stages of the value chain within their boundaries than more vertically integrated firms. A firm engages in backward vertical integration when it incorporates more stages of the value chain within its boundaries and those stages bring a firm closer to the beginning of the value chain, i.e., closer to gaining access to raw materials. A firm engages in forward vertical integration when it incorporates more stages of the value chain within its boundaries and those stages bring a firm closer to the end of the value chain, i.e., closer to interacting directly with final customers.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 4\nLearning Obj.:  8.2: Define Vertical Integration, Forward Vertical Integration, and Backward Vertical

Under high uncertainty vertical integration can commit a firm to a costly-to-reverse course of action and the flexibility of a non-vertically integrated may be preferred.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n59) Discuss the opportunism-based explanation of vertical integration value creation and identify when, under this explanation, firms should vertically integrate. In your answer be sure to clearly define opportunism and the role that transaction-specific investments play in the opportunism-based explanation.\nAnswer:  One of the best known explanations of when vertical integration can be valuable focuses on using vertical integration to reduce the threat of opportunism. Opportunism exists when a firm is unfairly exploited in an exchange. Obviously, when one of its exchange partners behaves opportunistically, this reduces the economic value of a firm. The threat of opportunism is greatest when a party to an exchange has made what are called transaction-specific investments. A transaction-specific investment is any investment in an exchange that has significantly more value in the current exchange than it does in alternative exchanges.\nOne way to reduce the threat of opportunism is to bring an exchange within the boundary of a firm. That is, one way to reduce the threat of opportunism is to vertically integrate into this exchange. This way, managers in a firm can directly monitor and control this exchange instead of relying on the market to manage this exchange. If the exchange that is brought within the boundary of a firm brings a firm closer to its ultimate suppliers, it is an example of backward vertical integration. If the exchange that is brought within the boundary of a firm brings a firm closer to its ultimate customer, it is an example of forward vertical integration.\nOf course, firms should only bring market exchanges within their boundaries when the cost of vertical integration is less than the cost of opportunism. If the cost of vertical integration is greater than the cost of opportunism, then firms should not vertically integrate into an exchange. This is the case for both backward and forward vertical integration decisions.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n60) Discuss the firm capabilities-based explanation of how vertical integration can create value. In your discussion identify the two broad implications of this approach and when, under this approach, firms should engage in vertical integration.\nAnswer:  The capabilities-based explanation of how vertical integration can create value focuses on firm capabilities and their ability to generate sustained competitive advantages. This approach has two broad implications. First, it suggests that firms should vertically integrate into those business activities where they possess valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources and capabilities. This way, firms can appropriate at least some of the profits that using these capabilities to exploit environmental opportunities will create. Second, this approach also suggests that firms should not vertically integrate into business activities where they do not possess the resources necessary to gain competitive advantages. Such vertical integration decisions would not be a source of profits to a firm since they do not possess any of the valuable, rare, or costly-to-imitate resources needed to gain competitive advantages in these business activities. Indeed, to the extent that some other firms have competitive advantages in these business activities, vertically integrating into them could put a firm at a competitive disadvantage. Under this approach, a firm should pursue vertical integration into an activity when it has valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources in a business activity, vertically integrate into that activity. If a firm does not have valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources in a business activity and other firms already engaging in this activity do, the firm will find itself at a competitive disadvantage.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 9\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n61) Discuss the flexibility-based explanation of vertical integration. In discussing this explanation be sure to define flexibility, the role of uncertainty in this explanation, and identify when, under this explanation, firms should engage in vertical integration.\nAnswer:  The flexibility-based explanation of vertical integration focuses on the impact of vertical integration on a firm's flexibility. Flexibility refers to how costly it is for a firm to alter its strategic and organizational decisions. Flexibility is high when the cost of changing strategic choices is low; flexibility is low when the cost of changing strategic choices is high. In general, vertical integration reduces flexibility since it has committed its organizational structure, its management controls, and its compensation policies to a particular vertically integrated way of doing business. When a decision-making environment is uncertain, that is when the future value of an exchange cannot be known; when investments in that exchange are being made, the value of vertical integration is decreased and should be avoided.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 10\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n62) Within the flexibility-based approach to vertical integration when should firms engage in strategic alliances instead of vertical integration, and what are the advantages of alliances under these conditions?\nAnswer:  A flexibility-based approach to vertical integration suggests that rather than vertically integrating into a business activity whose value is highly uncertain, firms should not vertically integrate and, instead, should form a strategic alliance to manage this exchange. A strategic alliance is more flexible than vertical integration but still gives a firm enough information about an exchange to estimate its value over time. \nAn alliance has a second advantage in this setting. The downside risks associated with investing in a strategic alliance are known and fixed. They equal the cost of creating and maintaining the alliance. If an uncertain investment turns out to not be valuable, parties to this alliance know the maximum amount they can lose, an amount equal to the cost of creating and maintaining the alliance. On the other hand, if this exchange turns out to be very valuable, then maintaining an alliance can give a firm access to this huge upside potential.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 11\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n63) A firm is likely to be among the first in its industry to vertically disintegrate an exchange when\nA) the firm concludes that the level of specific investment required to manage an economic exchange is high.\nB) the firm believes that the exchange is costly to imitate.\nC) the level of uncertainty about the value of an exchange has increased.\nD) the firm believes that the exchange is rare.\nAnswer:  C\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 16\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n64) Which of the following statements regarding direct duplication and substitutes for vertical integration is accurate?\nA) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices may be subject to direct duplication and substitutes.\nB) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices are subject to neither direct duplication nor substitutes.\nC) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices may be subject to direct duplication but not to substitutes.\nD) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices may be subject to substitutes but not to direct duplication.\nAnswer:  A\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 17\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n65) The major substitute for vertical integration is\nA) vertical disintegration.\nB) strategic alliances.\nC) a product-differentiation strategy.\nD) a low-cost strategy.\nAnswer:  B\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\nTerraLoc competes in the market for global positioning devices and services.

First, a firm may have developed a new technology or a new approach to doing business that requires its business partners to make substantial transaction-specific investments. Firms that engage in these activities will find it in their self-interest to vertically integrate, while firms that have not engaged in these activities will not find it in their self-interest to vertically integrate. If these activities are rare and costly to imitate, they can be a source of competitive advantage for a vertically integrating firm. Second, a firm may have unusual skills or capabilities. If these skills or capabilities are valuable and rare, then vertically integrating into businesses that exploit these capabilities can enable a firm to gain at least a temporary competitive advantage. Finally, a firm may be able to gain an advantage from vertically integrating when it resolves some uncertainty it faces sooner than its competition. In this situation, the firm no longer needs to retain the flexibility and can gain some of the advantages of vertical integration sooner than its competitors and can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 15\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical

Indeed, each of the exchanges included within the boundaries of a firm as a result of vertical integration decisions are incorporated into one of the functions in a functional organizational structure. From a CEO's perspective, coordinating functional specialists to implement a vertical integration strategy almost always involves conflict resolution. Conflicts among functional managers in a U-form organization are both expected and normal. Indeed, if there is no conflict among certain functional managers in a U-form organization, then some of these managers probably are not doing their jobs.\nThe task facing the CEO is not to pretend this conflict does not exist, or to ignore it, but to manage it in a way that facilitates strategy implementation. The CEO's job is to help resolve conflicts in ways that facilitate the implementation of the firm's strategy. Functional managers do not have to \"like\" each other. However, if a firm's vertical integration strategy is correct, the reason that a function has been included within the boundaries of a firm is that this decision creates value for the firm. Allowing functional conflicts to get in the way of taking advantage of each of the functions within a firm's boundaries can destroy this potential value.\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n99) Discuss the role of the budgeting process as a control mechanism in vertically integrated U-form organizations, the potential unintended negative consequence budgets can have, and three things CEOs can do to counter this potential consequence.\nAnswer:  Budgeting is one of the most important control mechanisms available to CEOs in vertically integrated U-form organizations. Indeed, in most U-form companies, enormous management effort goes into the creation of budgets and the evaluation of performance relative to budgets. Budgets are developed for costs, revenues, and a variety of other activities performed by a firm's functional managers. Often, managerial compensation and promotion opportunities depend on the ability of a manager to meet budget expectations.\nAlthough budgets are an important control tool, they can also have unintended negative consequences. For example, the use of budgets can lead functional managers to overemphasize short-term behavior that is easy to measure and underemphasize longer-term behavior that is more difficult to measure. CEOs can do a variety of things to counter the \"short-termism\" effects of the budgeting process. Three things a CEO can do to counter \"short-termism\" are to\n1. Ensure that the process used in developing budgets is open and participative\n2. Make sure the budgeting process reflects the economic reality facing functional managers and the firm, and\n3.

A firm's level of vertical integration is simply the number of steps in this value chain that a firm accomplishes within its boundaries. More vertically integrated firms accomplish more stages of the value chain within their boundaries than less vertically integrated firms. Less vertically integrated firms accomplish fewer stages of the value chain within their boundaries than more vertically integrated firms. A firm engages in backward vertical integration when it incorporates more stages of the value chain within its boundaries and those stages bring a firm closer to the beginning of the value chain, i.e., closer to gaining access to raw materials. A firm engages in forward vertical integration when it incorporates more stages of the value chain within its boundaries and those stages bring a firm closer to the end of the value chain, i.e.,

discuss how value is created under each.\nAnswer:  There are three explanations of how firms can create value through vertical integration:\na. Opportunism-Based Explanation: Reducing opportunistic threats from a firm's buyers and suppliers due to any transaction specific investments it may have made.\nb. Capabilities-Based Explanation: By enabling a firm to exploit its valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources and capabilities.\nc. Flexibility-Based Explanation: When the decision-making environment is uncertain, firms create value by engaging in vertical integration. Under high uncertainty vertical integration can commit a firm to a costly-to-reverse course of action and the flexibility of a non-vertically integrated may be preferred.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n59) Discuss the opportunism-based explanation of vertical integration value creation and identify when, under this explanation, firms should vertically integrate. In your answer be sure to clearly define opportunism and the role that transaction-specific investments play in the opportunism-based explanation.\nAnswer:  One of the best known explanations of when vertical integration can be valuable focuses on using vertical integration to reduce the threat of opportunism. Opportunism exists when a firm is unfairly exploited in an exchange. Obviously, when one of its exchange partners behaves opportunistically, this reduces the economic value of a firm. The threat of opportunism is greatest when a party to an exchange has made what are called transaction-specific investments. A transaction-specific investment is any investment in an exchange that has significantly more value in the current exchange than it does in alternative exchanges.\nOne way to reduce the threat of opportunism is to bring an exchange within the boundary of a firm. That is, one way to reduce the threat of opportunism is to vertically integrate into this exchange. This way, managers in a firm can directly monitor and control this exchange instead of relying on the market to manage this exchange. If the exchange that is brought within the boundary of a firm brings a firm closer to its ultimate suppliers, it is an example of backward vertical integration. If the exchange that is brought within the boundary of a firm brings a firm closer to its ultimate customer, it is an example of forward vertical integration.\nOf course, firms should only bring market exchanges within their boundaries when the cost of vertical integration is less than the cost of opportunism. If the cost of vertical integration is greater than the cost of opportunism, then firms should not vertically integrate into an exchange. This is the case for both backward and forward vertical integration decisions.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 7\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n60) Discuss the firm capabilities-based explanation of how vertical integration can create value. In your discussion identify the two broad implications of this approach and when, under this approach, firms should engage in vertical integration.\nAnswer:  The capabilities-based explanation of how vertical integration can create value focuses on firm capabilities and their ability to generate sustained competitive advantages. This approach has two broad implications. First, it suggests that firms should vertically integrate into those business activities where they possess valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources and capabilities. This way, firms can appropriate at least some of the profits that using these capabilities to exploit environmental opportunities will create. Second, this approach also suggests that firms should not vertically integrate into business activities where they do not possess the resources necessary to gain competitive advantages. Such vertical integration decisions would not be a source of profits to a firm since they do not possess any of the valuable, rare, or costly-to-imitate resources needed to gain competitive advantages in these business activities. Indeed, to the extent that some other firms have competitive advantages in these business activities, vertically integrating into them could put a firm at a competitive disadvantage. Under this approach, a firm should pursue vertical integration into an activity when it has valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources in a business activity, vertically integrate into that activity. If a firm does not have valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources in a business activity and other firms already engaging in this activity do, the firm will find itself at a competitive disadvantage.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 9\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n61) Discuss the flexibility-based explanation of vertical integration. In discussing this explanation be sure to define flexibility, the role of uncertainty in this explanation, and identify when, under this explanation, firms should engage in vertical integration.\nAnswer:  The flexibility-based explanation of vertical integration focuses on the impact of vertical integration on a firm's flexibility. Flexibility refers to how costly it is for a firm to alter its strategic and organizational decisions. Flexibility is high when the cost of changing strategic choices is low; flexibility is low when the cost of changing strategic choices is high. In general, vertical integration reduces flexibility since it has committed its organizational structure, its management controls, and its compensation policies to a particular vertically integrated way of doing business. When a decision-making environment is uncertain, that is when the future value of an exchange cannot be known; when investments in that exchange are being made, the value of vertical integration is decreased and should be avoided.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 10\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n62) Within the flexibility-based approach to vertical integration when should firms engage in strategic alliances instead of vertical integration, and what are the advantages of alliances under these conditions?\nAnswer:  A flexibility-based approach to vertical integration suggests that rather than vertically integrating into a business activity whose value is highly uncertain, firms should not vertically integrate and, instead, should form a strategic alliance to manage this exchange. A strategic alliance is more flexible than vertical integration but still gives a firm enough information about an exchange to estimate its value over time. \nAn alliance has a second advantage in this setting. The downside risks associated with investing in a strategic alliance are known and fixed. They equal the cost of creating and maintaining the alliance. If an uncertain investment turns out to not be valuable, parties to this alliance know the maximum amount they can lose, an amount equal to the cost of creating and maintaining the alliance. On the other hand, if this exchange turns out to be very valuable, then maintaining an alliance can give a firm access to this huge upside potential.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 11\nLearning Obj.:  8.3: Discuss How Vertical Integration can Create Value by (a) Reducing the Threat of Opportunism (b) Enabling a Firm to Exploit its Valuable, Rare, and Costly-to-Imitate Resources and Capabilities, (c) Enabling a Firm to Retain its Flexibility.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n63) A firm is likely to be among the first in its industry to vertically disintegrate an exchange when\nA) the firm concludes that the level of specific investment required to manage an economic exchange is high.\nB) the firm believes that the exchange is costly to imitate.\nC) the level of uncertainty about the value of an exchange has increased.\nD) the firm believes that the exchange is rare.\nAnswer:  C\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 16\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n64) Which of the following statements regarding direct duplication and substitutes for vertical integration is accurate?\nA) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices may be subject to direct duplication and substitutes.\nB) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices are subject to neither direct duplication nor substitutes.\nC) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices may be subject to direct duplication but not to substitutes.\nD) A firm's valuable and rare vertical integration choices may be subject to substitutes but not to direct duplication.\nAnswer:  A\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 17\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n65) The major substitute for vertical integration is\nA) vertical disintegration.\nB) strategic alliances.\nC) a product-differentiation strategy.\nD) a low-cost strategy.\nAnswer:  B\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\nTerraLoc competes in the market for global positioning devices and services.

First, a firm may have developed a new technology or a new approach to doing business that requires its business partners to make substantial transaction-specific investments. Firms that engage in these activities will find it in their self-interest to vertically integrate, while firms that have not engaged in these activities will not find it in their self-interest to vertically integrate. If these activities are rare and costly to imitate, they can be a source of competitive advantage for a vertically integrating firm. Second, a firm may have unusual skills or capabilities. If these skills or capabilities are valuable and rare, then vertically integrating into businesses that exploit these capabilities can enable a firm to gain at least a temporary competitive advantage. Finally, a firm may be able to gain an advantage from vertically integrating when it resolves some uncertainty it faces sooner than its competition. In this situation, the firm no longer needs to retain the flexibility and can gain some of the advantages of vertical integration sooner than its competitors and can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 15\nLearning Obj.:  8.4: Describe Conditions Under Which Vertical Integration can be a Source of Sustained Competitive Advantage.\nAACSB:  Analytical

Indeed, each of the exchanges included within the boundaries of a firm as a result of vertical integration decisions are incorporated into one of the functions in a functional organizational structure. From a CEO's perspective, coordinating functional specialists to implement a vertical integration strategy almost always involves conflict resolution. Conflicts among functional managers in a U-form organization are both expected and normal. Indeed, if there is no conflict among certain functional managers in a U-form organization, then some of these managers probably are not doing their jobs.\nThe task facing the CEO is not to pretend this conflict does not exist, or to ignore it, but to manage it in a way that facilitates strategy implementation. The CEO's job is to help resolve conflicts in ways that facilitate the implementation of the firm's strategy. Functional managers do not have to \"like\" each other. However, if a firm's vertical integration strategy is correct, the reason that a function has been included within the boundaries of a firm is that this decision creates value for the firm. Allowing functional conflicts to get in the way of taking advantage of each of the functions within a firm's boundaries can destroy this potential value.\nDiff: 3     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  8.5: Describe How the Functional Organization Structure, Management Controls, and Compensation Policies are used to Implement Vertical Integration.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n99) Discuss the role of the budgeting process as a control mechanism in vertically integrated U-form organizations, the potential unintended negative consequence budgets can have, and three things CEOs can do to counter this potential consequence.\nAnswer:  Budgeting is one of the most important control mechanisms available to CEOs in vertically integrated U-form organizations. Indeed, in most U-form companies, enormous management effort goes into the creation of budgets and the evaluation of performance relative to budgets. Budgets are developed for costs, revenues, and a variety of other activities performed by a firm's functional managers. Often, managerial compensation and promotion opportunities depend on the ability of a manager to meet budget expectations.\nAlthough budgets are an important control tool, they can also have unintended negative consequences. For example, the use of budgets can lead functional managers to overemphasize short-term behavior that is easy to measure and underemphasize longer-term behavior that is more difficult to measure. CEOs can do a variety of things to counter the \"short-termism\" effects of the budgeting process. Three things a CEO can do to counter \"short-termism\" are to\n1.
