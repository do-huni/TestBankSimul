The three broad categories of alliances include nonequity alliances, joint ventures and equity alliances. In a nonequity alliance, cooperating firms agree to work together to develop, manufacture, or sell products or services, but they do not take equity positions in each other or form an independent organizational unit to manage their cooperative efforts. Rather, these cooperative relations are managed through the use of various forms of contracts. In an equity alliance, cooperating firms supplement contracts with equity holdings in alliance partners. In a joint venture, cooperating firms create a legally independent firm in which they invest and from which they share any profits that are created.\\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 4\\nLearning Obj.:  11.1:

alliances.\\nAnswer:  TRUE\\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 12\\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances can Create Value for Firms.\\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\\n\\n\\n41) Identify and discuss the three ways alliances can create economic value by helping firms improve the performance of their current operations.\\nAnswer:  One way that firms can use strategic alliances to improve their current operations is to use alliances to realize economies of scale. To realize economies of scale, firms have to have a large volume of production, or at least a volume of production large enough so that the cost advantages associated with scale can be realized. When a firm cannot realize the cost savings from economies of scale all by itself, it may join in a strategic alliance with other firms. Jointly, these firms may have sufficient volume to be able to gain the cost advantages of economies of scale. \\nFirms can also use alliances to improve their current operations by learning from their competitors. Different firms in an industry may have different resources and capabilities and these resources can give some firms competitive advantages over other firms. Firms that are at a competitive disadvantage may want to form alliances with the firms that have an advantage in order to learn about their resources and capabilities.\\nFinally, firms can use alliances to improve their current operations through sharing costs and risks. This is especially valuable when the future state of the environment or the growth rate of the industry is uncertain.\\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 5\\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances can Create Value for Firms.\\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\\n42) Discuss the concept of a learning race and identify three reasons why firms in an alliance may differ in the rate they learn from each other.\\nAnswer:  A learning race exists in a strategic alliance when both parties to that alliance seek to learn from each other but when the rate at which these two firms learn varies. In this setting, the first firm to learn what it wants to learn from an alliance has the option to begin to underinvest in, and perhaps even withdraw from, an alliance. In this way, the firm that learns the fastest is able to prevent the slow-learning firm from learning all it wanted from an alliance. There are a variety of reasons why firms in an alliance may vary in the rate they learn from each other. First, they may be looking to learn different things, and some things are easier to learn than others. Second, firms may differ in terms of their ability to learn or their absorptive capacity. Firms with high levels of absorptive capacity will learn at higher rates than firms with low levels of absorptive capacity, even if these two firms are trying to learn exactly the same things in an alliance. Third, firms can engage in activities such as withholding information necessary to exploit technology in an alliance or withholding critical employees from an alliance to try to slow the rate of learning of their alliance partners.\\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 6\\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances can Create Value for Firms.\\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\\n\\n\\n43) What is the connection between strategic alliances and real options?\\nAnswer:  Real options are options that are embedded in certain decisions that a firm makes. A joint venture (which is a form of strategic alliance) is an option that a firm buys under conditions of uncertainty to retain the ability to move quickly into a market or industry if valuable opportunities present themselves. Thus, firms in new and uncertain environments develop numerous strategic alliances that they treat as real options.\\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 18\\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances

Hazard, and Holdup can Threaten the Ability of Alliances to Generate Value.\\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\\n64) Define the three fundamental forms of cheating in strategic alliances and discuss the short- and long-term implications of cheating in a strategic alliance.\\nAnswer:  The three ways to cheat in strategic alliances are adverse selection, moral hazard and holdup. Adverse selection occurs when potential partners misrepresent the value of the skills and abilities they bring to an alliance. In general, the less tangible the resources and capabilities that are to be brought to a strategic alliance, the more costly it will be to estimate their value before an alliance is created and the more likely is adverse selection to occur. Moral hazard occurs when partners provide to the alliance skills and capabilities of lower quality than they promised. Finally, holdup occurs when a firm that has not made significant transaction-specific investments demands from an alliance returns that are higher than what the partners agreed to when they created the alliance. In the short-run, firms that cheat on their alliance partners can gain some advantages. But research suggests that cheating does not pay in the long run. In the long run, firms that cheat on their alliance partners find it difficult to form alliances with new partners and thus have many valuable exchange opportunities foreclosed to them.\\nDiff: 2

resources can play in the rarity of strategic alliances.\\nAnswer:  The rarity of strategic alliances depends both on the number of competing firms that have already implemented an alliance and whether or not the benefits that firms obtain from their alliances are not common across firms competing in an industry. One of the reasons why the benefits that accrue from a particular strategic alliance may be rare is that relatively few firms may have the complementary resources and abilities needed to form an alliance. This is particularly likely when an alliance is formed to enter into a new market and especially a new foreign market. In many less developed economies, only one local firm or a very few local firms may exist with the local knowledge, contacts, and distribution network needed to facilitate entry into that market. Moreover, sometimes the government acts to limit the number of these local firms. Although several firms may seek entry into this market, only a very small number will be able to form a strategic alliance with the local entity and therefore the benefits that accrue to the allied firms will likely be rare.\\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 16\\nLearning Obj.:  11.4: Describe the Conditions Under which a Strategic Alliance can be Rare and Costly to Duplicate.\\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\\n\\n\\n84) Discuss when strategic alliances may be costly to directly duplicate.\\nAnswer:  To the extent that a strategic alliance goes well beyond simple legal contracts and is characterized by socially complex phenomena such as a trusting relationship between alliance partners, friendship, and even (perhaps) a willingness to suspend narrow self-interest for the longer-term good of the relationship, it will be costly for other firms to directly duplicate. Additionally, to the extent that the organizational and relationship-building skills required for successful alliance building are rare among a set of competing firms and costly to develop, strategic alliances will be costly to duplicate and firms that are able to exploit these abilities by creating alliances may gain competitive advantages.\\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 17\\nLearning Obj.:  11.4: Describe the Conditions Under which a Strategic Alliance can be Rare and Costly to Duplicate.\\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\\n85) Discuss when firms go it alone and identify three conditions under which alliances will be preferred to going it alone and when going it alone is not an attractive substitute for an alliance.\\nAnswer:  Firms go it alone when they attempt to develop all the resources and capabilities they need to exploit market opportunities and neutralize market threats by themselves. Sometimes, going it alone can create the same, or even more, value than using alliances to exploit opportunities and neutralize threats. In these settings, going it alone is a substitute for a strategic alliance. However, in other settings, using an alliance can create substantially more value than going it alone. In these settings, going it alone is not a substitute for a strategic alliance. In general, alliances will be preferred to going it alone when\\n1. The level of transaction-specific investment required to complex an exchange is moderate.\\n2. An exchange partner possesses valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources and capabilities.\\n3. There is great uncertainty about the future value of an exchange.\\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 17\\nLearning Obj.:  11.4: Describe the Conditions Under which a Strategic Alliance can be Rare and Costly to Duplicate.\\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\\n\\n86) Discuss to what extent acquisitions can be a substitute for alliances and identify four conditions under which alliances will be preferred to acquisitions.\\nAnswer:  The acquisition of other firms can be a substitute for alliances. In this case, rather than developing a strategic alliance or attempting to develop and exploit the relevant resources by going it alone, a firm seeking to exploit opportunities may simply acquire another firm that already possesses the relevant resources and capabilities. The four conditions under which alliances will be preferred to acquisitions are:\\n1. There are legal constraints on acquisitions.\\n2. Acquisitions limit a firm's flexibility under conditions of high uncertainty.\\n3. There is substantial unwanted organizational \\\"baggage\\\" in an acquired firm.\\n4.

Cheating in Strategic Alliances.\\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\\n\\n98) Describe five tools that firms can use to reduce the threat of cheating in strategic alliances.\\nAnswer:  The five tools firms can use to reduce the threat of cheating in strategic alliances are contracts, equity investments, firm reputations, joint ventures, and trust.\\nContracts. One way to avoid cheating in strategic alliances is for parties to an alliance to anticipate the ways in which cheating may occur (including adverse selection, moral hazard, and holdup) and to write explicit contracts that define legal liability if cheating does occur. Writing these contracts, together with the close monitoring of contractual compliance and the threat of legal sanctions, can reduce the probability of cheating.\\nEquity investments. The effectiveness of contracts can be enhanced by having partners in an alliance make equity investments in each other so that if one of the partners to an alliance cheats, they will be negatively impacted through their equity investment in their partner.\\nFirm reputations. Information about an alliance partner that has cheated is likely to become widely known. A firm with a reputation as a cheater is not likely to be able to develop strategic alliances with other partners in the future, despite any special resources or capabilities that it might be able to bring to an alliance. In this way, cheating in a current alliance may foreclose opportunities for developing valuable alliances. For this reason, firms may decide not to cheat in their current alliances.\\nJoint ventures. Creating a separate legal entity in which alliance partners invest and from whose profits they earn returns on their investments reduces some of the risks of cheating in strategic alliances. When a joint venture is created, the ability of partners to earn returns on their investments depends on the economic success of the joint venture. Partners in joint ventures have limited interests in behaving in ways that hurt the performance of the joint venture because such behaviors end up hurting themselves. Moreover, unlike reputational consequences of cheating, cheating in a joint venture does not just foreclose future alliance opportunities, it can hurt the cheating firm in the current period as well.\\nTrust. Trust, in combination with contracts, can help reduce the threat of cheating. More important, trust may enable partners to explore exchange opportunities that they could not explore if only legal and economic organizing mechanisms were in place.\\nDiff: 2     Page Ref:

In a nonequity alliance, cooperating firms agree to work together to develop, manufacture, or sell products or services, but they do not take equity positions in each other or form an independent organizational unit to manage their cooperative efforts. Rather, these cooperative relations are managed through the use of various forms of contracts. In an equity alliance, cooperating firms supplement contracts with equity holdings in alliance partners.

TRUE\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 12\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances can Create Value for Firms.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n41) Identify and discuss the three ways alliances can create economic value by helping firms improve the performance of their current operations.\nAnswer:  One way that firms can use strategic alliances to improve their current operations is to use alliances to realize economies of scale. To realize economies of scale, firms have to have a large volume of production, or at least a volume of production large enough so that the cost advantages associated with scale can be realized. When a firm cannot realize the cost savings from economies of scale all by itself, it may join in a strategic alliance with other firms. Jointly, these firms may have sufficient volume to be able to gain the cost advantages of economies of scale. \nFirms can also use alliances to improve their current operations by learning from their competitors. Different firms in an industry may have different resources and capabilities and these resources can give some firms competitive advantages over other firms. Firms that are at a competitive disadvantage may want to form alliances with the firms that have an advantage in order to learn about their resources and capabilities.\nFinally, firms can use alliances to improve their current operations through sharing costs and risks. This is especially valuable when the future state of the environment or the growth rate of the industry is uncertain.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 5\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances can Create Value for Firms.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n42) Discuss the concept of a learning race and identify three reasons why firms in an alliance may differ in the rate they learn from each other.\nAnswer:  A learning race exists in a strategic alliance when both parties to that alliance seek to learn from each other but when the rate at which these two firms learn varies. In this setting, the first firm to learn what it wants to learn from an alliance has the option to begin to underinvest in, and perhaps even withdraw from, an alliance. In this way, the firm that learns the fastest is able to prevent the slow-learning firm from learning all it wanted from an alliance. There are a variety of reasons why firms in an alliance may vary in the rate they learn from each other. First, they may be looking to learn different things, and some things are easier to learn than others. Second, firms may differ in terms of their ability to learn or their absorptive capacity. Firms with high levels of absorptive capacity will learn at higher rates than firms with low levels of absorptive capacity, even if these two firms are trying to learn exactly the same things in an alliance. Third, firms can engage in activities such as withholding information necessary to exploit technology in an alliance or withholding critical employees from an alliance to try to slow the rate of learning of their alliance partners.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 6\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances can Create Value for Firms.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n43) What is the connection between strategic alliances and real options?\nAnswer:  Real options are options that are embedded in certain decisions that a firm makes. A joint venture (which is a form of strategic alliance) is an option that a firm buys under conditions of uncertainty to retain the ability to move quickly into a market or industry if valuable opportunities present themselves. Thus, firms in new and uncertain environments develop numerous strategic alliances that they treat as real options.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 18\nLearning Obj.:  11.2: Describe How Strategic Alliances

cheating in strategic alliances and discuss the short- and long-term implications of cheating in a strategic alliance.\nAnswer:  The three ways to cheat in strategic alliances are adverse selection, moral hazard and holdup. Adverse selection occurs when potential partners misrepresent the value of the skills and abilities they bring to an alliance. In general, the less tangible the resources and capabilities that are to be brought to a strategic alliance, the more costly it will be to estimate their value before an alliance is created and the more likely is adverse selection to occur. Moral hazard occurs when partners provide to the alliance skills and capabilities of lower quality than they promised. Finally, holdup occurs when a firm that has not made significant transaction-specific investments demands from an alliance returns that are higher than what the partners agreed to when they created the alliance. In the short-run, firms that cheat on their alliance partners can gain some advantages. But research suggests that cheating does not pay in the long run. In the long run, firms that cheat on their alliance partners find it difficult to form alliances with new partners and thus have many valuable exchange opportunities foreclosed to them.\nDiff: 2

discuss the role that complementary resources can play in the rarity of strategic alliances.\nAnswer:  The rarity of strategic alliances depends both on the number of competing firms that have already implemented an alliance and whether or not the benefits that firms obtain from their alliances are not common across firms competing in an industry. One of the reasons why the benefits that accrue from a particular strategic alliance may be rare is that relatively few firms may have the complementary resources and abilities needed to form an alliance. This is particularly likely when an alliance is formed to enter into a new market and especially a new foreign market. In many less developed economies, only one local firm or a very few local firms may exist with the local knowledge, contacts, and distribution network needed to facilitate entry into that market. Moreover, sometimes the government acts to limit the number of these local firms. Although several firms may seek entry into this market, only a very small number will be able to form a strategic alliance with the local entity and therefore the benefits that accrue to the allied firms will likely be rare.\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 16\nLearning Obj.:  11.4: Describe the Conditions Under which a Strategic Alliance can be Rare and Costly to Duplicate.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n\n84) Discuss when strategic alliances may be costly to directly duplicate.\nAnswer:  To the extent that a strategic alliance goes well beyond simple legal contracts and is characterized by socially complex phenomena such as a trusting relationship between alliance partners, friendship, and even (perhaps) a willingness to suspend narrow self-interest for the longer-term good of the relationship, it will be costly for other firms to directly duplicate. Additionally, to the extent that the organizational and relationship-building skills required for successful alliance building are rare among a set of competing firms and costly to develop, strategic alliances will be costly to duplicate and firms that are able to exploit these abilities by creating alliances may gain competitive advantages.\nDiff: 1     Page Ref: 17\nLearning Obj.:  11.4: Describe the Conditions Under which a Strategic Alliance can be Rare and Costly to Duplicate.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n85) Discuss when firms go it alone and identify three conditions under which alliances will be preferred to going it alone and when going it alone is not an attractive substitute for an alliance.\nAnswer:  Firms go it alone when they attempt to develop all the resources and capabilities they need to exploit market opportunities and neutralize market threats by themselves. Sometimes, going it alone can create the same, or even more, value than using alliances to exploit opportunities and neutralize threats. In these settings, going it alone is a substitute for a strategic alliance. However, in other settings, using an alliance can create substantially more value than going it alone. In these settings, going it alone is not a substitute for a strategic alliance. In general, alliances will be preferred to going it alone when\n1. The level of transaction-specific investment required to complex an exchange is moderate.\n2. An exchange partner possesses valuable, rare, and costly-to-imitate resources and capabilities.\n3. There is great uncertainty about the future value of an exchange.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 17\nLearning Obj.:  11.4: Describe the Conditions Under which a Strategic Alliance can be Rare and Costly to Duplicate.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking\n\n86) Discuss to what extent acquisitions can be a substitute for alliances and identify four conditions under which alliances will be preferred to acquisitions.\nAnswer:  The acquisition of other firms can be a substitute for alliances. In this case, rather than developing a strategic alliance or attempting to develop and exploit the relevant resources by going it alone, a firm seeking to exploit opportunities may simply acquire another firm that already possesses the relevant resources and capabilities. The four conditions under which alliances will be preferred to acquisitions are:\n1. There are legal constraints on acquisitions.\n2. Acquisitions limit a firm's flexibility under conditions of high uncertainty.\n3. There is substantial unwanted organizational \"baggage\" in an acquired firm.\n4.

Thinking\n\n98) Describe five tools that firms can use to reduce the threat of cheating in strategic alliances.\nAnswer:  The five tools firms can use to reduce the threat of cheating in strategic alliances are contracts, equity investments, firm reputations, joint ventures, and trust.\nContracts. One way to avoid cheating in strategic alliances is for parties to an alliance to anticipate the ways in which cheating may occur (including adverse selection, moral hazard, and holdup) and to write explicit contracts that define legal liability if cheating does occur. Writing these contracts, together with the close monitoring of contractual compliance and the threat of legal sanctions, can reduce the probability of cheating.\nEquity investments. The effectiveness of contracts can be enhanced by having partners in an alliance make equity investments in each other so that if one of the partners to an alliance cheats, they will be negatively impacted through their equity investment in their partner.\nFirm reputations. Information about an alliance partner that has cheated is likely to become widely known. A firm with a reputation as a cheater is not likely to be able to develop strategic alliances with other partners in the future, despite any special resources or capabilities that it might be able to bring to an alliance. In this way, cheating in a current alliance may foreclose opportunities for developing valuable alliances. For this reason, firms may decide not to cheat in their current alliances.\nJoint ventures. Creating a separate legal entity in which alliance partners invest and from whose profits they earn returns on their investments reduces some of the risks of cheating in strategic alliances. When a joint venture is created, the ability of partners to earn returns on their investments depends on the economic success of the joint venture. Partners in joint ventures have limited interests in behaving in ways that hurt the performance of the joint venture because such behaviors end up hurting themselves. Moreover, unlike reputational consequences of cheating, cheating in a joint venture does not just foreclose future alliance opportunities, it can hurt the cheating firm in the current period as well.\nTrust. Trust, in combination with contracts, can help reduce the threat of cheating. More important, trust may enable partners to explore exchange opportunities that they could not explore if only legal and economic organizing mechanisms were in place.\nDiff: 2     Page Ref: 20\nLearning Obj.:  11.5: Describe How Contracts, Equity Investments, Firm Reputations, Joint Ventures, and Trust can All Reduce the Threat of Cheating in Strategic Alliances.\nAACSB:  Analytical Thinking`;\n\nexport default text11;"],"mappings":"AAAA,GAAM,CAAAA,MAAM,8jjDAwxBgB,CAE5B,cAAe,CAAAA,MAAM"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
