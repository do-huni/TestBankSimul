25) Identify and distinguish between the five different levels of diversification discussed in Chapter 7.
Answer:  The five different levels of diversification that firms can pursue:
Single-business firms?These firms operate in a single business and 95% or more of firm revenues come from this business.
Dominant-business diversification?Firms using this type of limited diversification strategy operate in two or more businesses, one of which accounts for between 70% and 95% of firm revenues.
Related-constrained diversification?A firm using this type of related diversification operates in multiple businesses, none of which accounts for more than 70% of firm revenues that share a significant number of dimensions including inputs, production technologies, distribution channels, similar customers, etc. This strategy is termed "constrained" because corporate managers pursue business opportunities in new markets or industries only if those markets or industries share numerous resource and capability requirements with the businesses the firm is currently pursuing.
Related-linked diversification?Firms using this type of related diversification operate in multiple businesses, none of which accounts for more than 70% of a firm's revenues, and these businesses share only a couple of dimensions or have businesses that are linked along very different dimensions.
Unrelated corporate diversification?When less than 70 percent of a firm's revenues is generated in a single product market and when a firm's businesses share few, if any, common attributes, then that firm is pursuing a strategy of unrelated corporate diversification.

72) Specify the two conditions that a corporate diversification strategy must meet in order to create economic value.
Answer:  In order for corporate diversification to be economically valuable, two conditions must hold. First, there must be some valuable economy of scope among the multiple businesses in which a firm is operating. Second, it must be less costly for managers in a firm to realize these economies of scope than for outside equity holders on their own. If outside investors could realize the value of a particular economy of scope on their own, and at low cost, then they would have few incentives to "hire" managers to realize this economy of scope for them.

73) Define the concept of economies of scope, discuss when they are valuable and identify and differentiate between four of the eight potential economies of scope a diversified firm might try to exploit.
Answer:  Economies of scope exist in a firm when the value of the products or services it sells increases as a function of the number of businesses that firm operates in. The term "scope" in this definition refers to the range of businesses in which a diversified firm operates. For this reason, only diversified firms can, by definition, exploit economies of scope. Economies of scope are valuable to the extent that they increase a firm's revenues or decrease its costs, compared to what would be the case if these economies of scope were not exploited.
There are eight different types of economies of scope:
? Shared activities in which a firm's businesses share a variety of activities throughout their value chains can serve as the basis for operational economies of scope.
? Core competencies are complex sets of resources and capabilities that link different businesses in a diversified firm through managerial and technical know-how, experience, and wisdom.
? Internal capital allocation. In a sense, diversification creates an internal capital market in which businesses in a diversified firm compete for corporate capital. An internal capital market creates value for a diversified firm when it offers some efficiency advantages over an external capital market.
? Risk reduction. Diversified firms can achieve a lower level of risk if they build a business portfolio that has a low correlation between the cash flows of the businesses in the portfolio.
? Tax advantages. A diversified firm can use losses in some of its businesses to offset profits in others, thereby reducing its overall tax liability. Second, because diversification can reduce the riskiness of a firm's cash flows, it can also reduce the probability that a firm will declare bankruptcy. This can increase a firm's debt capacity, which is particularly important in tax environments where interest payments on debt are tax deductible.
? Multipoint competition is an anticompetitive economy of scope that exists when two or more diversified firms simultaneously compete in multiple markets. Multipoint competition can serve to facilitate a particular type of tacit collusion called mutual forbearance in which firms forgo acts of competitive strategies in one business because of the possibility of retaliation by a competitor in another business.
? Exploiting market power. Internal allocations of capital among a diversified firm's businesses may enable it to exploit in some of its businesses the market power advantages it enjoys in other of its businesses through actions such as subsidizing the operations of another of its businesses.
? Maximizing management compensation. Managers seeking to maximize their income should attempt to grow their firm. One of the easiest ways to grow a firm is through diversification, especially unrelated diversification through mergers and acquisitions that can allow a diversified firm to grow substantially in a short period of time, leading senior managers to earn higher incomes.

74) Discuss shared activities as a potential source of economies of scope for diversified firms and identify the potential benefits and limits of activity sharing.
Answer:  When the companies in a diversified firm share a variety of activities throughout their value chains, these activities can serve as the basis for operational economies of scope. Potential shared activities can be found throughout a firm's value chain from input activities through dealer support and service. Activity sharing can have the effect of reducing a diversified firm's costs, and failure to exploit share activities across business can lead to out-of-control costs. Shared activities can also increase the revenues in a diversified firm's businesses through shared product development and sales activities as well as by enhancing business revenues by exploiting strong, positive reputations of some of a firm's businesses in other of its businesses. There are three important limits to activity sharing. First, substantial organizational issues can be associated with a diversified firm's learning how to manage cross-business relationships. Second, sharing activities may limit the ability of a particular business to meet its specific customer's needs. Finally, if one business in a diversified firm has a poor reputation, sharing activities with that business can reduce the quality of the reputation of other businesses in the firm.

75) Identify and discuss the two economies of scope that do not have the potential for generating positive returns for a firm's outside equity investors.
Answer:  The only two economies of scope that do not have the potential for generating positive returns for a firm's equity holders are diversification in order to maximize the size of a firm and diversification to reduce risk. Diversification in order to maximize the size of a firm does not generate positive returns because firm size, per se, is not valuable. Diversification in order to reduce risk does not generate positive returns because equity holders can do this on their own at a very low cost by simply investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks.

At the beginning of 2001, Peach Computers competed exclusively in the computer industry and generated approximately 96% of its revenue from the sales of computers and computer-related software and approximately 4% of its revenues were generated from sales of other peripherals. Further, of these revenues, 60% was from sales in the U.S., 30% was from sales in Europe, 7% was from sales in Asia and 3% was from other areas. In October 2001, Peach entered the personal electronics industry by introducing a new MP3 player known as the PeachPit. In developing and selling the PeachPit, Peach Computers was able to use many of the same R&D facilities, suppliers, production facilities, and distribution and sales outlets as the computers and software Peach Computers traditionally sold. By 2003, the PeachPit MP3 Player, accessories for the unit, and sales of songs on Peach Computers' NectarTunes website accounted for 35% of Peach Computers' revenues.

95) Discuss the conditions under which a firm's diversification strategy will be rare.
Answer:  The rarity of diversification depends not on diversification per se but on how rare the particular economies of scope associated with that diversification are. If only a few competing firms have exploited a particular economy of scope, that economy of scope can be rare. If numerous firms have done so, it will be common and not a source of competitive advantage.

96) Identify which economies of scope are more likely to be subject to low-cost imitation and which are less likely to be subject to low-cost imitation and discuss why each is either costly or less costly to duplicate.
Answer:  The extent to which a valuable and rare corporate diversification strategy is immune from direct duplication depends on how costly it is for competing firms to realize this same economy of scope. Some economies of scope are, in general, more costly to duplicate than others. Shared activities, risk reduction, tax advantages, and employee compensation as bases for corporate diversification are usually relatively easy to duplicate. Because shared activities are based on tangible assets that a firm exploits across multiple businesses, such as common R&D labs, common sales forces, and common manufacturing, they are usually relatively easy to duplicate. The only duplication issues for shared activities concern developing the cooperative cross-business relationships that often facilitate the use of shared activities. Moreover, because risk reduction, tax advantages, and employee compensation motives for diversifying can be accomplished through both related and unrelated diversification, these motives for diversifying tend to be relatively easy to duplicate.
On the other hand, other economies of scope are much more difficult to duplicate. These difficult-to-duplicate economies of scope include core competencies, internal capital allocation efficiencies, multipoint competition, and exploitation of market power. Because core competencies are more intangible, their direct duplication is often challenging. The realization of capital allocation economies of scope requires very substantial information-processing capabilities. These capabilities are often very difficult to develop. Multipoint competition requires very close coordination between the different businesses in which a firm operates. This kind of coordination is socially complex and thus may often be immune from direct duplication. Finally, exploitation of market power may be costly to duplicate because it requires that a firm must possess significant market power in one of its lines of business. A firm that does not have this market power advantage would have to obtain it. The cost of doing so, in most situations, would be prohibitive.

97) Identify two potential substitutes for corporate diversification and discuss how each can provide benefits similar to corporate diversification.
Answer:  Two obvious substitutes for diversification exist. First, instead of obtaining cost or revenue advantages from exploiting economies of scope across businesses in a diversified firm, a firm may decide to simply grow and develop each of its businesses separately. In this sense, a firm that successfully implements a cost-leadership strategy or a product-differentiation strategy in a single business can obtain the same cost or revenue advantages it could have obtained by exploiting economies of scope, but without having to develop cross-business relations. Growing independent businesses within a diversified firm can be a substitute for exploiting economies of scope in a diversification strategy.
A second substitute for exploiting economies of scope in diversification can be found in strategic alliances. By using a strategic alliance, firms may be able to gain the economies of scope they could have obtained if they had carefully exploited economies of scope across businesses they own. Thus, for example, instead of a firm exploiting research and development economies of scope between two businesses it owns, it could form a strategic alliance with a different firm and form a joint research and development lab. Instead of a firm exploiting sales economies of scope by linking its businesses through a common sales force, it might develop a sales agreement with another firm and obtain cost or revenue advantages in this way.
