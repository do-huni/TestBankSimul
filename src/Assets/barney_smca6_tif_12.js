19) Discuss the differences between mergers and acquisitions and differentiate between friendly and unfriendly acquisitions.
Answer:  A firm engages in an acquisition when it purchases a second firm. An acquiring firm can use cash it has generated from its ongoing businesses to purchase a target firm, it can go into debt to purchase a target firm, it can use its own equity to purchase a target firm, or it can use a mix of these mechanisms to purchase a target firm. Also, an acquiring firm can purchase all of a target firm's assets, it can purchase a majority of those assets (greater than 51%), or it can purchase a controlling share of those assets (i.e., enough assets so that the acquiring firm is able to make all the management and strategic decisions in the target firm). Acquisitions can be friendly (when the management of the target firm wants to be acquired) or unfriendly (when the management of the target firm does not want to be acquired). Some unfriendly acquisitions are also known as hostile takeovers. When the assets of two similar-sized firms are combined, this transaction is called a merger.

65) If there are five bidders (each of which has a current market value of $50,000 ) interested in a target firm that has no strategic relatedness with any of the bidding firms and has a current market value of $25,000, identify the economic profits that will be earned by both the bidding firm's equity holders and the target firm's equity holders and discuss this case.
Answer:  The economic value created for both the target firm and the bidding firm will be zero. The value for the bidding firm will be zero because the value of any one of the bidding firms when combined with the target firm exactly equals the sum of the value of these firms as separate entities. The price of this acquisition will quickly rise to $25,000 because any bid less than $25,000 will generate economic profits for a successful bidder that will, in turn, generate entry into a bidding war for a target. Therefore, the price will quickly rise to its value, and economic profits will not be created. Alternately, the target firm's equity holders will also gain zero economic profits since the market value of the target firm has not been increased; it has only been capitalized in the form of a cash payment from the bidder to the target. The target was worth $25,000 and that is exactly what these equity holders will receive.

Answer:  The five different FTC categories of mergers and acquisitions are vertical merger, horizontal merger, product extension merger, market extension merger, and conglomerate merger. A vertical merger occurs when a firm acquires former suppliers or customers. In a horizontal merger, a firm acquires a former competitor. A product extension merger occurs when a firm gains access to complementary products through an acquisition. In a market extension merger, a firm gains access to complementary markets though an acquisition. Finally, in a conglomerate merger, there is no strategic relatedness between a bidding firm and a target firm.

67) Identify the three potential sources of strategic relatedness between bidding and target firms that were detailed by Lubatkin in 1983 and the four general reasons why bidding firms might want to engage in merger and acquisitions as detailed by Jensen and Ruback in 1983.
Answer:  The three potential sources of strategic relatedness between bidding and target firms that Lubatkin identified in 1983 are:
? Technical economies, which are scale economies that occur when the physical processes inside a firm are altered so that the same amounts of input produce a higher quantity of outputs.
? Pecuniary economies that are achieved by the ability of firms to dictate prices by exerting market power.
? Diversification economies that are achieved by improving a firm's performance relative to its risk attributes or lowering its risk attributes to its performance.
The four general reasons that bidding firms might want to engage in merger and acquisitions as detailed by Jensen and Ruback in 1983 are:
? To reduce production or distribution costs.
? To pursue financial motivations such as gaining access to underutilized tax shields, avoiding bankruptcy costs, to increase leverage opportunities, and to gain other tax advantages.
? To gain market power in product markets.
? To eliminate inefficient management in the target firm.

68) If there is one target firm with a current market value of $20,000 as a stand-alone entity and five bidding firms, each of which has a current market value of $30,000 as a stand-alone entity, and the value of the target firms and any of the bidding firms combined is $60,000, estimate the price the bidding firms would be willing to pay for the target firm and the return to stockholders of bidding and target firms when there is strategic relatedness between firms.
Answer:  If bidding and target firms are strategically related, then the economic value of these two firms combined is greater than the economic value of these two firms as separate entities. The market value of the target firm as a stand-alone entity is $20,000, and the market value of the bidding firms as stand-alone entities is $30,000. The value of any of the bidding firms and the target combined is $60,000. Bidding firms will be willing to pay a price for a target up to the value that a target firm adds once it is acquired. Thus, the maximum price bidding firms are willing to pay is still the difference between the value of the combined entity (here, $60,000) and the value of a bidding firm on its own (here, $30,000). 
The price for actually acquiring the target firm in this scenario will rapidly rise to $30,000 because any bid less than $30,000 has the potential for generating profits for a bidding firm. At this $30,000 price, the successful bidding firm earns zero economic profits. After all, this firm has acquired an asset that will generate $30,000 of value and has paid $30,000 to do so. However, the owners of the target firm will earn an economic profit worth $10,000. As a stand-alone firm, the target is worth $20,000; when combined with a bidding firm, it is worth $30,000. The difference between the value of the target as a stand-alone entity and its value in combination with a bidding firm is the value of the economic profit ($10,000) that can be appropriated by the owners of the target firm.
Thus, the existence of strategic relatedness between bidding and target firms is not a sufficient condition for the equity holders of bidding firms to earn economic profits from their acquisition strategies. If the economic potential of acquiring a particular target firm is widely known and if several potential bidding firms can all obtain this value by acquiring a target, the equity holders of bidding firms will, at best, earn only zero economic profits from implementing an acquisition strategy. In this setting, a "strategically related" merger or acquisition will create economic value, but this value will be distributed in the form of economic profits to the equity holders of acquired target firms.

69) Describe and discuss five reasons why bidding firms might still engage in acquisitions even if, on average, they do not create value for a bidding firm's stockholders.
Answer:  The five possible motivations to engage in mergers and acquisitions even though they do not generate profits for bidding firms are to ensure survival, to invest free cash flow, agency problems, managerial hubris, and the potential for above-normal profits.
To ensure survival. Even if mergers and acquisitions, on average, generate only zero economic profits for bidding firms, it may be necessary for bidding firms to engage in these activities to ensure their survival. In particular, if all of a bidding firm's competitors have been able to improve their efficiency and effectiveness through a particular type of acquisition, then failing to make such an acquisition may put a firm at a competitive disadvantage. Here, the purpose of a merger or acquisition is not to gain competitive advantages but rather to gain competitive parity.
To invest free cash flow. Free cash flow is simply the amount of cash a firm has to invest after all positive net present-value investments in a firm's ongoing businesses have been funded. Free cash flow is created when a firm's ongoing business operations are very profitable but offer few opportunities for additional investment. In this context, merger and acquisition strategies are a viable option as bidding firms, on average, can expect to generate at least competitive parity. Put differently, while mergers and acquisitions may not be a source of superior profits, there are worse things a firm could do with its free cash flow.
Agency problems. Another reason why firms might continue to engage in mergers and acquisitions despite earning only competitive parity from doing so is that mergers and acquisitions benefit managers directly, independent of any value they may or may not create for a bidding firm's stockholders. Merger and acquisition strategies can benefit managers, even if they do not directly benefit a bidding firm's equity holders, in at least two ways. First, managers can use mergers and acquisitions to help diversify their human capital investments in their firm. Second, managers can use mergers and acquisitions to quickly increase firm size, measured in either sales or assets. If management compensation is closely linked to firm size, managers who increase firm size are able to increase their compensation.
Managerial hubris. Managers can fall victim to managerial hubris, or the unrealistic belief held by managers in bidding firms that they can manage the assets of a target firm more efficiently than can the target firm's current management. This notion can lead bidding firms to engage in acquisition strategies even though there may not be positive economic profits from doing so.
The potential for above-normal profits. A final reason why managers might continue to pursue merger and acquisition strategies is the potential that these strategies offer for generating profits for at least some bidding firms. The empirical research on returns to bidding firms in mergers and acquisitions is very strong. On average, bidding firms do not gain profits from their merger and acquisition strategies. However, just because bidding firms, on average, do not earn profits on these strategies does not mean that all bidding firms will always fail to earn profits. In some situations, bidding firms may be able to gain competitive advantages from merger and acquisition activities.

89) Identify and discuss six rules that firms bidding on a target firm in an acquisition should follow to increase the possibility that an acquisition strategy will earn superior performance.
Answer:  In pursuing an acquisition, there are six rules that firms bidding on a target firm should follow to increase the possibility that the target firm will earn superior performance. These rules are:
? Search for valuable and rare economies of scope. Bidding firms should seek to acquire targets with which they enjoy valuable and rare linkages. Operationally, the search for rare economies of scope suggests that managers in bidding firms need to consider not only the value of a target firm when combined with their own company, but also the value of a target firm when combined with other potential bidders. This is important because it is the difference between the value of a particular bidding firm's relationship with a target and the value of other bidding firms' relationships with that target that defines the size of the potential economic profits from an acquisition.
? Keep information away from bidders. One of the keys to earning superior performance in an acquisition strategy is to avoid multiple bidders for a single target. One way to accomplish this is to keep information about the bidding process, and about the sources of economies of scope between a bidder and target that underlie this bidding process, as private as possible.
? Keep information away from targets. Unless it is illegal to do so, bidding firms must not fully reveal the value of their economies of scope with a target firm.
? Avoid winning bidding wars. If a number of firms bid for the same target, the probability that the firm that successfully acquires the target will gain competitive advantages is very low. Therefore, it is to a bidding firm's advantage to avoid a bidding war.
? Close the deal quickly. All the economic processes that make it difficult for bidding firms to earn economic profits from acquiring a strategically related target take time to unfold. It takes time for other bidders to become aware of the economic value associated with acquiring a target; it takes time for the target to recruit other bidders; information leakage becomes more of a problem over time; and so forth. A bidding firm that begins and ends the bidding process quickly may forestall some of these processes and thereby retain some superior performance for itself from an acquisition.
? Operate in thinly traded acquisitions markets. A thinly traded market is a market where there is only a small number of buyers and sellers, where information about opportunities in this market is not widely known, and where interests besides purely maximizing the value of a firm can be important. In the context of mergers and acquisitions, thinly traded markets are markets where only a few (often only one) firms are implementing acquisition strategies. These unique firms may be the only firms that understand the full value of the acquisition opportunities in this market. Even target firm managers may not fully understand the value of the economic opportunities in these markets, and even if they do, they may have other interests besides maximizing the value of their firm if it becomes the object of a takeover.

90) Identify and discuss the three rules that target firm managers should follow to maximize the probability of earning economic profits from their merger and acquisition strategies.
Answer:  The three rules that managers of target firms should follow to maximize the probability of earning economic profits from their merger and acquisition strategies are:
? Seek information from bidders. Target firms must inform themselves about the resources and capabilities of current and potential bidders. In this way, target firms can become fully aware of the value that they hold for bidders, and they are more likely to be able to extract this full value in the acquisition process.
? Invite other bidders to join the bidding competition. Once a target firm is fully aware of the nature and value of the economies of scope that exist between it and current bidding firms, it can exploit this information by seeking other firms that may have the same relationship with it and then informing these firms of a potential acquisition opportunity. By inviting other firms into the bidding process, the target firm increases the competitiveness of the market for corporate control, thereby increasing the probability that the value by an acquisition will be fully captured by the target firm.
? Delay but do not stop the acquisition. To increase the probability of receiving more than one bid, target firms have a strong incentive to delay an acquisition. The objective, however, should be to delay an acquisition to create a more competitive market for corporate control, not to stop an acquisition.

91) Describe three major challenges that firms integrating acquisitions are likely to face.
Answer:  Although, in general, organizing to implement merger and acquisition strategies can be seen as a special case of organizing to implement corporate diversification strategies or vertical integration strategies, implementing merger and acquisition strategies can create special problems. Most of these problems reflect the fact that operational, functional, strategic, and cultural differences between bidding and target firms involved in a merger or acquisition are likely to be much greater than these same differences between the different parts of a diversified or vertically integrated business that was not created through acquisition. The reason for this difference is that the firms involved in a merger or acquisition have had a separate existences, separate histories, separate management philosophies, and separate strategies.
One of the most significant challenges in integrating bidding and target firms has to do with cultural differences. Simply because a firm has been acquired does not mean that the culture in that firm will rapidly change to become more like the culture of the bidding firm. Indeed, cultural conflicts can last for very long periods of time. For example, the difference between the relative success of Renault's acquisition of Nissan and Daimler-Chrysler's acquisition of Mitsubishi discussed in the opening case of this chapter has largely been attributed to the inability of Mitsubishi to modify its traditional management culture.
Operational, functional, strategic, and cultural differences between bidding and target firms can all be compounded by the merger and acquisition process especially if that process was unfriendly. Unfriendly takeovers can generate in target firm management anger and animosity toward the management of the bidding firm. Research has shown that top management turnover is much higher in firms that have been taken over compared to firms not subject to takeovers, reflecting one approach to resolving these management conflicts.
The difficulties often associated with organizing to implement a merger and acquisition strategy can be thought of as an additional cost of the acquisition process. Bidding firms, in addition to estimating the value of the strategic relatedness between themselves and a target firm, also need to estimate the cost of organizing to implement an acquisition. The value that a target firm brings to a bidding firm through an acquisition should be discounted by the cost of organizing to implement this strategy. In some circumstances, it may be the case that the cost of organizing to realize the value of strategic relatedness between a bidding firm and a target may be greater than the value of that strategic relatedness, in which case the acquisition should not occur. For this reason, many observers argue that potential economies of scope between bidding and target firms are often not fully realized.

92) How are poison pills different from shark repellents?
Answer:  Both poison pills and shark repellents are mechanisms available to target firms to prevent being taken over. Poison pills include a variety of actions that target firm managers can take to make the acquisition of the target prohibitively expensive. One example of a poison pill is when the target firm issues rights to its current stockholders indicating that if the firm is acquired in an unfriendly takeover, it will distribute a special cash dividend to its stockholders. This cash dividend effectively increases the cost of the acquisition, thereby making it less attractive to the bidding firm.
In contrast, shark repellents are a variety of relatively minor corporate governance changes that, in principle, are supposed to make it somewhat more difficult to acquire a target firm. An example would be the supermajority voting rule, in which more than 50 percent of the target firm's board of directors must approve the takeover.
