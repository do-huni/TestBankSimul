23) What is collusion?
Answer:  Firms pursuing the generic strategies of cost leadership, product differentiation, or flexibility are essentially generating economic profits by more efficiently and effectively meeting their customer's needs. In such approaches, the source of profits is the differential strategic efficiency and effectiveness of a firm. Collusion exists when firms in an industry or market cooperate to reduce competition. Thus, firms engaged in collusion are attempting to profit, not via efficiency or effectiveness, but by reducing competition.

24) What are the two types of collusion and how are they different?
Answer:  Collusion can take one of two forms, explicit collusion or tacit collusion. Explicit collusion exists when firms in an industry directly negotiate agreements about how to reduce competition. When members of OPEC met and agreed to reduce oil shipments in 1973, they were engaged in explicit collusion. Explicit collusion is illegal in most developed countries. Tacit collusion exists when firms cooperate in reducing competition, but engage in no face to face negotiations to do so. Tacit collusion can be legal. However, firms that engage in any kind of collusion face fundamental ethical challenges.

91) How does signaling relate to collusion?
Answer:  In tacit collusion, firms agree to reduce competition but do so without face to face negotiations. Tacit collusion, in short, is implemented via signals and signaling. Signaling both promotes tacit collusion as well as work to reduce the impact of such collusion. Signals can be tough or soft. In a tough signal, if parties cheat on collusive agreements, the firm sending the signal will decrease prices more or increase output more than would have otherwise been the case. Tough signals keep tacit collusion in check. In contrast, in a soft signal, if parties cheat on collusive agreements, the firm sending the signal will decrease its prices less or increase its output less than would have otherwise been the case. Essentially, the firm sending a soft signal is indicating that it is avoiding competition.

92) How does product homogeneity facilitate tacit collusion?
Answer:  One of the industry attributes that facilitates tacit collusion is product homogeneity. Tacit collusion is more likely when firms produce and sell similar products or services. In general, changes in prices are easier to monitor than are changes in product characteristics or features. A firm may cheat on a tacit collusion strategy by charging the agreed upon price but providing more features, higher quality, or better service (thereby creating heterogeneity in its offerings). These efforts at product differentiation are somewhat more difficult to monitor and thus create strong incentives for cheating. When product homogeneity is high, cheating is easier to monitor.

93) Who are price leaders and what effect does their presence have on tacit collusion?
Answer:  A price leader is a firm that sets "acceptable" industry prices or "acceptable" profit margins in an industry. Typically, the price leader is the one with the largest market share. This helps create the order and discipline needed to make tacit collusion last over time. Also, a price leader can assist an industry adjusting to higher or lower prices, without jeopardizing an overall cooperative agreement, by defining industry standards for price or margin changes. Thus, the existence of a price leader creates opportunities for tacit collusion in an industry.

94) While there are several industry attributes that facilitate tacit collusion, entry barriers are considered the most important. Why?
Answer:  Without barriers to entry, the economic profits associated with tacit collusion create incentives for firms to enter into an industry. New entry into an industry reduces the collusion-enhancing attributes of the other industry characteristics. For example, new entry is likely to create both product heterogeneity (as new firms introduce new products) and cost heterogeneity (new firms often have costs different from colluding incumbents). In general, new entrants can be thought of as loose cannons in otherwise placid and calm industries. To reduce the threat of new entrants, tacitly colluding firms must be protected by barriers to entry.

95) How does industry social structure explain collusion among Major League Baseball franchises in the 1980s?
Answer:  Industry social structure refers to accepted norms of behavior and competition that often evolve in industries. These norms are usually implicit and constitute what might be called an industry culture. While each Major League Baseball franchise is independently owned, franchise owners must cooperate in leagues to establish playing schedules, a common set of rules, and other operating standards. While engaging in this legal cooperation, informal agreements not to bid aggressively on free agents were apparently struck. An arbitrator ruled that the owners had colluded.
