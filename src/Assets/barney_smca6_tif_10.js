54) Describe the multidivisional, or M-form structure, and how it is used to implement a corporate diversification strategy.
Answer:  The most common organizational structure for implementing a corporate diversification strategy is the M-form, or multidivisional, structure. The M-form structure is designed to create checks and balances for managers in a firm that increase the probability that a diversified firm will be managed in ways consistent with the interests of its equity holders. In the multidivisional structure, each business that the firm engages in is managed through a division, which is treated as a true profit-and-loss center in that the profits and losses are calculated at the level of the division in these firms. Divisions in an M-form organization typically adopt a U-form structure and are large enough to represent identifiable business entities but small enough so that a division general manager can effectively manage each one.

55) Define what constitutes an agency relationship and the roles of the principal and the agent; discuss how the agency relationship is reflected in the context of corporate diversification and when the agency relationship can be effective; and identify two common agency problems.
Answer:  An agency relationship exists whenever one party to an exchange delegates decision-making authority to a second party. In the agency relationship, the party delegating the decision-making authority is called the agent and the party to whom the authority is delegated is called the agent. In the context of corporate diversification, an agency relationship exists between a firm's outside equity holders (as principals) and its managers (as agents) to the extent that equity holders delegate the day-to-day management of their investment to those managers. The agency relationship between equity holders and managers can be very effective as long as managers make investment decisions in ways that are consistent with equity holders' interests. Thus, if equity holders are interested in maximizing the rate of return on their investment in a firm and if managers make their investment decisions with this objective in mind, then equity holders will have few concerns about delegating the day-to-day management of their investments to managers. Unfortunately, in numerous situations the interests of a firm's outside equity holders and its managers do not coincide. When parties in an agency relationship differ in their decision-making objectives, agency problems arise. Two common agency problems have been identified:
1. Managers can decide to take some of a firm's capital and invest it in managerial perquisites that do not add economic value to the firm but do directly benefit those managers.
2. To the extent that very risky investments may jeopardize a firm's survival and thus management's compensation and positions, managers may be more risk averse in their decision making than equity holders would prefer them to be.

56) Describe the nature and role of the board of directors in an M-form organization and discuss who generally serves on the board, the role of outside members on a board of directors and when the roles of CEO and chairman of the board should be combined or separated.
Answer:  In an M-form organization, the board of director's primary responsibility is to monitor decision making in the firm to ensure that it is consistent with the interests of outside equity holders. In principle, all of a firm's senior managers report to the board. A board of directors typically consists of 10 to 15 individuals drawn from a firm's top management group and from individuals outside the firm. A firm's senior executive (often identified by the title president, chief executive officer, or CEO), its chief financial officer (CFO), and a few other senior managers are usually on the board although outsiders typically outnumber managers on the board. The firm's senior executive is often but not always the chairman of the board. The task of managerial board members, including the board chair, is to provide other board members information and insights about critical decisions being made in the firm and the effect those decisions are likely to have on a firm's equity holders. The task of outsiders on the board is to evaluate the past, current, and future performance of the firm and of its senior managers to ensure that the actions taken in the firm are consistent with equity holders' interests. Outside directors, as compared to insiders, tend to focus more on monitoring a firm's economic performance rather than other measures of firm performance. Outside board members are also more likely than inside members to dismiss CEOs following poor performance. Also, outside board members have a stronger incentive than inside members to maintain their reputation as effective monitors. This incentive by itself can lead to more effective monitoring by outside board members. Moreover, the monitoring effectiveness of outside board members seems to be substantially enhanced when they personally own a substantial amount of a firm's equity. There is currently some debate about whether the roles of board chair and CEO should be combined or separated, and if separated, what kinds of people should occupy these positions. Empirical research on this question suggests that whether the roles of CEO and chairman should be combined or not depends on the complexity of the information analysis and monitoring task facing the CEO and chairman. Some researchers have found that combining the roles of CEO and chairman is positively correlated with firm performance when firms operate in slow-growth and simple competitive environments, environments that do not overtax the cognitive capability of a single individual. This finding suggests that combining these roles does not necessarily increase conflicts between a firm and its equity holders. This research also found that separating the roles of CEO and board chair is positively correlated with firm performance when firms operate in high-growth and very complex environments. In such environments, a single individual cannot fulfill all the responsibilities of both CEO and chairman, and thus the two roles need to be held by separate individuals.

57) Discuss the role of institutional investors in an M-form organization. In addressing this question, be sure to identify who institutional investors are and discuss trends in institutional ownership and whether institutional investors encourage managers to act in ways that are consistent with the interests of equity holders or if institutional investors are overly myopic.
Answer:  Institutional owners are usually pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies or other groups of individual investors that have joined together to manage their investments. In 1970, institutions owned 32 percent of the equity traded in the United States. By 1990, institutions owned 48 percent of this equity. In 2005, they owned 59% of the equity traded in the United States. Institutional investors can use their investment clout to insist that a firm's management behaves in ways consistent with the interests of equity holders. Observers who assume that institutional investors are interested more in maximizing the short-term value of their portfolios than in the long-term performance of firms in those portfolios fear that such power will force firms to make only short-term investments. Recent research in the United States and Japan, however, suggests that institutional investors are not unduly myopic. Additionally, other researchers have shown that high levels of institutional ownership leads firms to sell strategically unrelated businesses. This effect of institutional investors is enhanced if, in addition, outside directors on a firm's board have substantial equity investments in the firm.

58) Identify the responsibilities of the senior executive in an M-form organization and discuss the three different roles in the office of the president and the responsibilities of each role.
Answer:  The senior executive (the president or CEO) in an M-form organization has two responsibilities: strategy formulation and strategy implementation. Strategy formulation entails deciding in which set of businesses a diversified firm will operate. At the broadest level, deciding which businesses a diversified firm should operate in is equivalent to discovering and developing valuable economies of scope among a firm's current and potential businesses. If these economies of scope are also rare and costly to imitate, they can be a source of sustained competitive advantage for a diversified firm. The senior executive is uniquely positioned to discover, develop, and nurture valuable economies of scope in a diversified firm, but the senior executive in an M-form organization should involve numerous other divisional and functional managers in strategy formulation to ensure complete and accurate information as input to the process and a broad understanding of and commitment to that strategy once it has been formulated. Strategy implementation focuses on encouraging behavior in a firm that is consistent with this strategy and almost always involves resolving conflicts within and between each of the major managerial components of the M-form structure: corporate staff, division general managers, and shared activity managers. It is often the case that the roles and responsibilities of the senior executive in an M-form organization are greater than what can be reasonably managed by a single individual. This is especially likely if a firm is broadly diversified across numerous complex products and markets. In this situation, it is not uncommon for the tasks of the senior executive to be divided among two or three people: the chairman of the board (responsible for the supervision of the board of directors in its monitoring role), the chief executive officer (responsible for strategy formulation), and the chief operating officer (responsible for strategy implementation). Together, these roles are known as the office of the president.

59) Discuss the role of division general managers in an M-form organization and compare and contrast this role with that of senior executives in U-form organizations.
Answer:  Division general managers in an M-form organization have primary responsibility for managing the day-to-day operations of a firm's businesses. Division general managers have full profit-and-loss responsibility and typically have multiple functional managers reporting to them. As general managers, they have both strategy formulation and strategy implementation responsibilities. On the strategy formulation side, division general managers choose strategies for their divisions within the broader strategic context established by the senior executive of the firm.
The strategy implementation responsibilities of division general managers in an M-form organization parallel the strategy implementation responsibilities of senior executives in U-form organizations. In particular, division general managers must be able to coordinate the activities of often conflicting functional managers in order to implement a division's strategies.
In addition to their responsibilities as a U-form senior executive, division general managers in an M-form organization have two additional responsibilities: to compete for corporate capital and to cooperate with other divisions to exploit corporate economies of scope. Division general managers compete for corporate capital by promising high rates of return on capital invested in previous periods by the corporations in their business. In most firms, divisions that have demonstrated the ability to generate high rates of return on earlier capital investments gain access to more capital, or to lower-cost capital, compared to divisions that have not demonstrated a history of such performance.
Division general managers cooperate to exploit economies of scope by working with shared activity managers, corporate staff managers, and the senior executive in the firm to isolate, understand, and use the economies of scope around which the diversified firm was originally organized. Division general managers can even become involved in discovering new economies of scope that were not anticipated when the firm's diversification strategy was originally implemented but nevertheless may be both valuable and costly for outside investors to create on their own.

90) Discuss the role of accounting measures of divisional performance, identify three different standards of comparison that can be used when evaluating the accounting performance of a division along with the strengths and weaknesses of each standard, and describe the potential weaknesses of accounting measures of divisional performance.
Answer:  Common accounting measures of divisional performance include the return on the assets controlled by a division, the return on a division's sales, and a division's sales growth. These accounting measures of divisional performance are then compared with some standard to see if a division's performance exceeds or falls short of that standard. Diversified firms use three different standards of comparison when evaluating the performance of a division: (1) a hurdle rate that is common across all the different business units in a firm, (2) a division's budgeted level of performance (which may vary by division), and (3) the average level of profitability of firms in a division's industry.
Each of these standards of comparison has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, if a corporation has a single hurdle rate of profitability that all divisions must meet or exceed, there is little ambiguity about the performance objectives of divisions. On the other hand, such a single standard ignores important differences in performance that might exist across divisions. Comparing a division's actual performance to its budgeted performance allows the performance expectations of different divisions to vary, but the budgeting process is time consuming and fraught with political intrigue. Finally, while comparing a division's performance with the average level of profitability of firms in a division's industry also allows performance expectations to vary across divisions within a diversified firm, this approach lets other firms determine what is and is not excellent performance for a division within a diversified firm. This approach can also be manipulated: By choosing just the "right" firms with which to compare a division's performance, almost any division can be made to look like it's performing better than its industry average.
No matter what standard of comparison is used to evaluate a division's accounting performance, most accounting measures of divisional performance have a common limitation. All these measures have a short-term bias. This short-term bias reflects the fact that all these measures treat investments in resources and capabilities that have the potential for generating value in the long run and costs during a particular year.

91) Discuss the relationship between accounting methods of measuring divisional performance and economic methods, identify the formula used for calculating economic value added, and discuss methods for adjusting accounting earnings and the importance of making these adjustments.
Answer:  Economic methods build on accounting methods but adjust those methods to incorporate short-term investments that may generate long-term benefits. Economic methods also compare a division's performance with a firm's cost of capital. This avoids some of the gaming that can characterize the use of other standards of comparison in applying accounting measures of divisional performance.
Perhaps the most popular of these economically oriented measures of division performance is known as economic value added or EVA. EVA is calculated by subtracting the cost of capital employed in a division from that division's earnings in the following manner:
EVA = adjusted accounting earnings - (weighted average cost of capital �� total capital employed by a division)
The calculation of economic value added begins with a division's "adjusted" accounting earnings. These are a division's traditional accounting earnings adjusted so that they approximate what would be a division's economic earnings. Several adjustments to a division's accounting statements have been described in the literature. For example, traditional accounting practices require R&D spending to be deducted each year from a division's earnings. This can lead division general managers to underinvest in longer-term R&D efforts. In the EVA measure of divisional performance, R&D spending is added back into a division's performance and R&D is then treated as an asset and depreciated over some period of time. By adjusting a division's earnings and accounting for the cost of investing in a division, economic value added is a much more accurate estimate of a division's economic performance than are traditional accounting measures of performance.

92) Discuss the role of transfer pricing systems in an M-form organization, identify difficulties with setting optimal prices, and identify four alternative transfer pricing schemes.
Answer:  The transfer of intermediate products or services produced in one division that are used as inputs for products or services produced by a second division of a multidivisional firm is usually managed through a transfer-pricing system in which one division "sells" its product or service to a second division for a transfer price. Unlike a market price, which is typically determined by market forces of supply and demand, transfer prices are set by a firm's corporate management to accomplish corporate objectives.
From an economic point of view, the rule for establishing the optimal transfer price in a diversified firm is quite simple: The transfer price should be the value of the opportunities forgone when one division's product or service is transferred to another division. Setting transfer prices equal to opportunity costs sounds simple enough, but it is very difficult to do in real diversified firms. Establishing optimal transfer prices requires information about the value of the opportunities forgone by the "selling" division. This, in turn, requires information about this division's marginal costs, its manufacturing capacity, external demand for its products, and so forth. Much of this information is difficult to calculate. Moreover, it is rarely stable. As market conditions change, demand for a division's products can change, marginal costs can change, and the value of opportunities forgone can change. Also, to the extent that a selling division customizes the products or services it transfers to other divisions in a diversified firm, the value of the opportunities forgone by this selling division become even more difficult to calculate.
Even if this information could be obtained and updated rapidly, division general managers in selling divisions have strong incentives to manipulate the information in ways that increase the perceived value of the opportunities forgone by their division. These division general managers can thus increase the transfer price for the products or services they sell to internal customers and thereby appropriate for themselves profits that should have been allocated to buying divisions.
Four alternative transfer pricing schemes that firms use in practice:
? Exchange autonomy in which buying and selling division general managers are free to negotiate transfer price without corporate involvement and the transfer price is set equal to the selling division's price to external customers.
? Mandated full cost in which the transfer price is set equal to the selling division's actual cost of product or to the selling division's standard cost.
? Mandated market price in which the transfer price is set equal to the market price in the selling division's market.
? Dual pricing in which the transfer price for the buying division is set equal to the selling division's actual or standard costs and the transfer price for the selling division is equal to the price to external customers or the market price in the selling division's market.

98) Discuss the importance of compensation policies in diversified firms and identify the CEO compensation package that most closely aligns the interests of the CEO with those of stockholders.
Answer:  A firm's compensation policies constitute a final set of tools for implementing corporation diversification. To the extent that compensation in diversified firms gives managers incentives to make decisions consistent with stockholder's interests, they can be an important part of the process of implementing corporate diversification. Traditionally, the compensation of corporate managers in a diversified firm has been only loosely connected to the firm's economic performance. Research indicates that differences in CEO cash compensation (salary plus cash bonus) are not very responsive to differences in firm performance but if a substantial percentage of a CEO's compensation came in the form of stock and stock options in the firm, changes in compensation would be closely linked with changes in the firm performance. These and similar findings reported elsewhere have led more and more diversified firms to include stock and stock options as part of the compensation package for the CEO to more closely align the interests of the CEO with those of stockholders.
